    <description><![CDATA[<p>And of course, no sooner than I finished my previous post and decided to deploy the site than I ran into a bunch of problems, some bigger than others.</p>
<p>First, I had to set the DNS record to point at GitHub Pages. And that takes time to propogate and I am <em>impatient</em>.</p>
<p>The DNS wasn&rsquo;t propogating and GH was tellng me that I&rsquo;d configured something wrong, so it recommended that I set <code>A</code> records to point at the GitHub Pages IP addresses&hellip;except it didn&rsquo;t actually link to where I could <em>find</em> those IP addresses.</p>
<p>I finally found them buried in GH&rsquo;s documentation, but I&rsquo;ll be damned if I can find the page again, even with searching through my browser history.</p>
<p>I also set up the <code>CNAME</code> record at the same time.</p>
<p>Then I had to set up the GitHub workflow to actually deploy from my repo to the page&ndash;and unbeknownst to me, there was a <em>critical</em> piece of missing information from the workflow as written.</p>
<p>And that piece of information was setting <code>cname: peculiar.monster</code> in the deploy script.</p>
<p>Seriously. <code>CNAME</code> kept on disappearing from the <code>gh-pages</code> branch and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why until I looked at <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action#%EF%B8%8F-add-cname-file-cname" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this GH Action</a> which mentioned setting <code>CNAME</code>, while <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">the Hugo-specific action</a>&ndash;the one I chose to use&ndash;did not mention it anywhere. No wonder it was being removed!</p>
<p>So, with that sorted, I turned my attention to why either the theme or Hugo wasn&rsquo;t respecting my <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> tag. Turned out that <em>Hugo</em> was respecting it just fine and the theme absolutely was not&ndash;and of course, this isn&rsquo;t actually documented <em>in</em> the theme.</p>
<p>After digging through the CSS, I figured out where the problem was, it was in a bit of code from <code>themes/LoveIt/assets/css/_page/_home.scss</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt"> 1
</span><span class="lnt"> 2
</span><span class="lnt"> 3
</span><span class="lnt"> 4
</span><span class="lnt"> 5
</span><span class="lnt"> 6
</span><span class="lnt"> 7
</span><span class="lnt"> 8
</span><span class="lnt"> 9
</span><span class="lnt">10
</span><span class="lnt">11
</span><span class="lnt">12
</span><span class="lnt">13
</span><span class="lnt">14
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-scss" data-lang="scss"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nc">.home</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">data-home</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nt">posts</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="nc">.summary</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="nc">.content</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="k">@include</span><span class="nd"> box</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ni">vertical</span><span class="p">);</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="na">text-overflow</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="ni">ellipsis</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="k">@include</span><span class="nd"> overflow-wrap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ni">break-word</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="na">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nv">$global-font-secondary-color</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>I did delete the classes that weren&rsquo;t relevant to the problem at hand&ndash;the <code>home[data-home=posts]</code> class has a <em>lot</em> going on, more than is relevant to explain the current problem.</p>
<p>A bit of research, however, quickly helped me to figure out that <code>-webkit-line-clamp: 3;</code> was the culprit. It was restricting the summary display to three lines, it was a class I am not familiar with, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the options were.</p>
<p>Now, how to fix it?</p>
<p>I am not a methodical sort of person, alas&ndash;and looking at the code condensed like I did above actually helped me to get to a solution&ndash;but my normal way of doing things is to just throw lines of code at the problem and see if anything sticks. This is a terrible habit that I&rsquo;m trying to break&ndash;it was fine when coding was something I did occasionally and for fun, but it&rsquo;s not great when I&rsquo;m trying to write code at work.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the answer, to the LoveIt theme disrespecting summary length and the <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> tag, placed within <code>assets/css/_custom.scss</code>. ðŸ˜…</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2
</span><span class="lnt">3
</span><span class="lnt">4
</span><span class="lnt">5
</span><span class="lnt">6
</span><span class="lnt">7
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-scss" data-lang="scss"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nc">.home</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">data-home</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nt">posts</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="nc">.summary</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="nc">.content</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="na">-webkit-line-clamp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="ni">none</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>Then there was the problem with the paragraphs not being properly separated and the spacing just being weird. That was easy to solve, just a few more lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2
</span><span class="lnt">3
</span><span class="lnt">4
</span><span class="lnt">5
</span><span class="lnt">6
</span><span class="lnt">7
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-scss" data-lang="scss"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nc">.home</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">data-home</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nt">posts</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="nc">.summary</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="nc">.content</span> <span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">      <span class="na">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="ni">block</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    <span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>And there, everything is so much more to my liking. ðŸŽ‰</p>]]></description>

    <title>Hello World</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>While this is a new site, I am not new to blogging. I&rsquo;ve been blogging one way or another since 1999, give or take. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of different sites over the years&ndash;from Diaryland to Greymatter to Movable Type to LiveJournal to WordPress and now I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Hugo</a> because, to be quite honest, I am unhappy with the direction WordPress has taken their product&ndash;they seem to assume that everyone wants to sell something and too often what&rsquo;s for sale is a piece of someone&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>I have no desire to make this site generate any sort of regular source of income or to leverage it into something bigger than what it is. I&rsquo;m not looking for visibility or followers or to become any sort of influencer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a place to document my life and how I&rsquo;m living it.</p>
<p>I <em>miss</em> writing for its own sake. There are so many things I want to write about and haven&rsquo;t felt as if I can, in part because technology is getting in my way.</p>
<p>WordPress is an unwieldy beast and every time I log on, there&rsquo;s <em>something</em> that needs updating. I hate that things I&rsquo;d consider to be part of the core functionality of a CMS isn&rsquo;t there and there&rsquo;s a whole ecosystem of people making their living selling that core functionality to you&ndash;and if they run on a freemium model, the plugins call home, which is a significant privacy and security concern.</p>
<p>I am planning to mothball my old site and unpublishing nearly all the posts; what I&rsquo;m planning on leaving behind will be converted to static site, probably using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">11ty</a>, because playing with frameworks is fun and their name makes me laugh.</p>
<p>Like many others, I have become increasingly disillusioned with the algorithmic web and with the centering of search engine optimization and selling when it comes to publishing online.</p>
<p>For example: Twitter doesn&rsquo;t show me the tweets I&rsquo;m interested in, instead it shows me what will make me angry or despairing. Facebook lets me know know which of my friends and family are not-so-secret bigots (I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve deleted that by now except FB Messenger is the main way I talk to my sister and dad). Instagram seems to exist in order to make me feel bad about myself or to tempt me into buying things I really don&rsquo;t need. None of this is good for my mental health.</p>
<p>I was <a href="https://institute.global/policy/social-media-futures-what-brigading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">brigaded on Twitter</a> earlier this year for a casual, off-hand remark I made to some friends after the Hugo Awards ceremony and the ringleaders harassed me for <em>months</em> for no reason other that they <em>could</em>. And because I was not someone that the wider SFF community perceived as important, I was more or less left to deal with it alone. (Those of you who did support me, you have my ðŸ’œ forever. The rest of you? ðŸ–• )</p>
<p>So this is an attempt to get back to basics&ndash;to write a few times a week about how I&rsquo;m feeling (current status: ow my pancreas), about what I&rsquo;m reading, and whatever else I want. And most importantly: to work at becoming a <em>better</em> writer.</p>
<p>I want to get away from the corporatized and capitalism-focused web and back to what attracted me to the internet in the first place: finding interesting people and reading what they have to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not planning on glossing over any of my health issues, but I&rsquo;m not going to wallow in them or present myself as some sort of heroine fighting a battle with her body: my goal is to make peace with this body, as it&rsquo;s the only one I get to have. And if I have to use assistive devices and medications in order to keep going, then that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do. And I&rsquo;m going to talk about it&ndash;there are so few of us who have survived necrotizing pancreatitis writing honestly about what it&rsquo;s like that I feel I owe it to my past self to do so.</p>
<p>But my disability isn&rsquo;t all of who I am: I am also a voracious reader and I make things with yarn. I&rsquo;m also a JavaScript developer and I work for a really neat little company and it&rsquo;s so <em>good</em>, especially when compared with my prior job, which was actively making my health worse through an abusive manager who knew how to use the corporate bureaucracy to her benefit.</p>
<p>I think most of you reading this have noticed that I&rsquo;m not using any part of my legal name on this site, although it is not difficult to discover. I am asking that this deliberate omission be respected as much as possible. I&rsquo;m respecting your privacy by not using any cookies or other tracking technologies, so please respect mine.</p>
<p>Finally: welcome, world. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here for this journey. Let&rsquo;s have some fun.</p>]]></description>
