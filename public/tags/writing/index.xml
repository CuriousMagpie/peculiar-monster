      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that I have not one, but two kanban boards? One for getting this site set up as I want it to be, and another for mothballing my old site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both have a LOT of things on them. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this evening, I knocked out a fair number of backend things I wanted to fix on this site, primarily with the CSS. I figured out what all the different files were doing, removed the parts that were irrelevant (goodbye stupid jquery menu on mobile), and did my various imports in a way that made sense for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also replaced a few things with links to CDNs instead of hosting the entire content here&amp;ndash;that allows me to keep up to date with the most current version of things but it does add a vulnerability in case those CDNs go down. They&amp;rsquo;re mostly for things like some of the icons and the CSS frameword the original author chose to use. If the CDNs do go down, things will degrade gracefully until they come back up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a completely different topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks on Twitter have been so kind and I wrote yesterday about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://peculiar.monster/posts/f-stands-for-fungible&#34;&gt;reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to distance myself from fandom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to give an example of the sort of lifting of phrasing/ideas in such a way that it&amp;rsquo;s clear that my work was the inspiration&amp;ndash;I ran across this just last night:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote on August 1, 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin made the decision to first mention her unprecedented accomplishment of winning the Best Novel three years in a row–-no one else of any race or gender has ever accomplished a Best Novel hat trick–-and then attempt to undermine it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the the essay I ran across yesterday, that author wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin has also been criticized for disrespecting the award winners, mispronouncing names and undercutting accomplishments like N. K. Jemisin’s “hat trick” of three Hugo awards for best novel in as many years,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a word for word lifting, but as far as I know, I am the person who first referred to Jemisin&amp;rsquo;s historic achievement as a &amp;ldquo;hat trick,&amp;rdquo; and I immedately followed it with Martin&amp;rsquo;s attempt to undermine it. (I included the content of his undermining attempt, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this piece, the author uses undercut before mentioning Jemisin&amp;rsquo;s achievement. I know that undercut &lt;strong&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong&gt; the same word, but it can be used interchangeably with undermine in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not linking the essay in question because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stir up trouble, but this is the sort of low-grade theft I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with for the last decade. My essays are good enough to read and gain inspiration from, but not good enough to cite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll also note that apart my words, the author did an excellent job both sourcing and citing their sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please think about why that may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of my post, I was accused of posting for clout, for hating George, for using indecent language, for being jealous, fo being all sorts of things I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know why I posted it? I was angry. I was angry that someone with the stature of George R.R. Martin couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to take the time to learn how to say people&amp;rsquo;s names, but took the time to figure out which hat he was going to wear for which segment and which action figures he was going to put on display. I was angry that he made the entire ceremony about how good the past was, with no acknowledgement that the past SUCKED for a lot of people and still SUCKS for them STILL. I was angry on behalf of my friends and colleagues who had turned on the ceremony excited to see their works celebrated and who instead THAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I swore. And yeah, I used a metaphor involving the sun. And yeeting people into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I happened to be the first person to post any sort of response online. Which is the only reason it got the audience that it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine, how I felt afterwards, being accused of everything I wasn&amp;rsquo;t and also knowing that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t defend myself. It was like all those writing workshops all over again: I had to sit and take the abuse in silence. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking the abuse in (relative) silence for nearly two years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just been a lot. And I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to be writing a lot about my trauma here&amp;ndash;not just with regards to fandom, but also about my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been forewarned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>F Stands for Fungible</title>
      <link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/f-stands-for-fungible/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 16:55:10 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/f-stands-for-fungible/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started the process of mothballing my old site last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really hard to go through nearly 700 posts and unpublish them, leaving only the ones I&amp;rsquo;m planning on archiving on a static site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, really hard. Also hard was seeing people respond on Twitter to my statement a few days ago that I was shutting the site down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been, personally, a terrible few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my health, my career, and now I&amp;rsquo;m losing the vast majority of my social network. I am &lt;strong&gt;gutted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing harassment, silencing, and other kinds of abuse I&amp;rsquo;ve had to deal with over the nearly 10 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing there&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s just too much. I think that if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t felt so alone during last year&amp;rsquo;s Hugo season and if people with larger platforms on social media had done &lt;strong&gt;something&lt;/strong&gt; to defend me instead of choosing to let me be the tank for people&amp;rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the Hugo ballot&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that was a &lt;strong&gt;choice&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s not pretend that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. A lot of people knew how distressed I was by the bad faith arguments and the intimations that if I were a decent person, I&amp;rsquo;d have refused the nomination and they chose to say and do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then when I was brigaded by a bunch of leftier-than-thou jackasses after the Hugos&amp;ndash;again, no support. The fiction finalists who received abuse did get a lot of support, but when I posted in the finalist Slack that I was also being abused and the only other person who responded was another fan, well. That showed me who the SFF community finds importand and who they don&amp;rsquo;t. Shortly after, I quietly peaced out of the Slack since I no longer felt welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often joke that F doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand for fan, it stands for fungible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fungible&lt;/strong&gt;: being something (such as money or a commodity) of such a nature that one part or quantity may be replaced by another equal part or quantity in paying a debt or settling an account&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, fans like myself are seen by many pro writers and SMOFs as interchangeable cogs in the SFF community. And since we are fungible, when someone&amp;rsquo;s pushed aside or leaves, well, it&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal. Someone else will certainly come along. And I am definitely feeling disposable. Surely, there will come along someone else to fill my particular niche in the SFF community. I wish them luck, because they&amp;rsquo;re going to need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked a little bit about what I&amp;rsquo;ve had to deal with over the last ten years, let me make it explicit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;professional writers I thought were friends not only expressing relief that my essay didn&amp;rsquo;t win a Hugo, but the fact that it was nominated was a disgrace and saying so in a place where I could not only see it, but interact with it&amp;ndash;and their silence when I expressed my disappointment that they hadn&amp;rsquo;t bothered to hide it from me
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the comments on said post, some of which called my nomination the worst thing ever to happen to the Hugos, &lt;strong&gt;worse&lt;/strong&gt; than that time Harlan Ellison grabbed Connie Willis&amp;rsquo;s breast at the Hugo Awards Ceremony (there is video, you can look it up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aforementioned brigading by a bunch of leftier-than-thou jackasses on Twitter
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ringleaders have also made photoshopped memes of a post I deleted which they think is &lt;strong&gt;hilarious&lt;/strong&gt; (it&amp;rsquo;s not)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one of them also published a &amp;ldquo;poem&amp;rdquo; which was &amp;ldquo;inspired&amp;rdquo; by my deleted tweet and which also included the image and the tweet&amp;rsquo;s text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their creation of a &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo; in SFF that they can&amp;rsquo;t even define cogently which appears to have been created, in part, as a way to direct harassment towards me by getting the attention of professional writers with a significant platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ongoing defense of the subject of my essay, which is just weird because he&amp;rsquo;s a cis het white man with a swimming pool full of money: presumably everything they hate about capitalism and the power structures it sustains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having my work appropriated by professional non-fiction writers and not credited and when they were asked to credit me, made pathetic excuses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;endless accusations of whining, of jealousy, or of just wanting more traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;friendly advice&amp;rdquo; to be less blunt, to be nicer, to be quiet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abusive comments calling me names, making fun of my appearance, telling me to die and/or kill myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doxxed 3 times in 2 years by trolls, Worldcon, and SFWA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legitimate criticism and engaging with my arguments? I have no problem with that. It&amp;rsquo;s when all this other stuff happens and happens because I&amp;rsquo;m saying things that people don&amp;rsquo;t like or don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear or because I don&amp;rsquo;t look the way they think I should (pray tell, how &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; I look?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s been ongoing for nearly 10 years and for the most part, the attacks are &lt;strong&gt;coming from inside the house&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it any wonder that I feel like I need a little space to re-grow and to find my voice again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m not sad about walking away: I am. I know that there are many people that I will lose touch with, since I won&amp;rsquo;t be interacting with them on Twitter or seeing them at conventions. I know that when I do start attending conventions again, I won&amp;rsquo;t be asked to be on programming anymore&amp;ndash;and I love being on panels and I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that I&amp;rsquo;m good at being on panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, eventually, I&amp;rsquo;ll feel comfortable shedding this pseudonym. For now, though, it&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello World</title>
      <link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/hello-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 20:06:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/hello-world/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a new site, I am not new to blogging. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging one way or another since 1999, give or take. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of different sites over the years&amp;ndash;from Diaryland to Greymatter to Movable Type to LiveJournal to WordPress and now I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; because, to be quite honest, I am unhappy with the direction WordPress has taken their product&amp;ndash;they seem to assume that everyone wants to sell something and too often what&amp;rsquo;s for sale is a piece of someone&amp;rsquo;s soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no desire to make this site generate any sort of regular source of income or to leverage it into something bigger than what it is. I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for visibility or followers or to become any sort of influencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a place to document my life and how I&amp;rsquo;m living it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;miss&lt;/em&gt; writing for its own sake. There are so many things I want to write about and haven&amp;rsquo;t felt as if I can, in part because technology is getting in my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress is an unwieldy beast and every time I log on, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that needs updating. I hate that things I&amp;rsquo;d consider to be part of the core functionality of a CMS isn&amp;rsquo;t there and there&amp;rsquo;s a whole ecosystem of people making their living selling that core functionality to you&amp;ndash;and if they run on a freemium model, the plugins call home, which is a significant privacy and security concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning to mothball my old site and unpublishing nearly all the posts; what I&amp;rsquo;m planning on leaving behind will be converted to static site, probably using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.11ty.dev/&#34;&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt;, because playing with frameworks is fun and their name makes me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many others, I have become increasingly disillusioned with the algorithmic web and with the centering of search engine optimization and selling when it comes to publishing online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: Twitter doesn&amp;rsquo;t show me the tweets I&amp;rsquo;m interested in, instead it shows me what will make me angry or despairing. Facebook lets me know know which of my friends and family are not-so-secret bigots (I&amp;rsquo;d&amp;rsquo;ve deleted that by now except FB Messenger is the main way I talk to my sister and dad). Instagram seems to exist in order to make me feel bad about myself or to tempt me into buying things I really don&amp;rsquo;t need. None of this is good for my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://institute.global/policy/social-media-futures-what-brigading&#34;&gt;brigaded on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year for a casual, off-hand remark I made to some friends after the Hugo Awards ceremony and the ringleaders harassed me for &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; for no reason other that they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;. And because I was not someone that the wider SFF community perceived as important, I was more or less left to deal with it alone. (Those of you who did support me, you have my :purple_heart: forever. The rest of you? :fu: )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is an attempt to get back to basics&amp;ndash;to write a few times a week about how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling (current status: ow my pancreas), about what I&amp;rsquo;m reading, and whatever else I want. And most importantly: to work at becoming a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to get away from the corporatized and capitalism-focused web and back to what attracted me to the internet in the first place: finding interesting people and reading what they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not planning on glossing over any of my health issues, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to wallow in them or present myself as some sort of heroine fighting a battle with her body: my goal is to make peace with this body, as it&amp;rsquo;s the only one I get to have. And if I have to use assistive devices and medications in order to keep going, then that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do. And I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about it&amp;ndash;there are so few of us who have survived necrotizing pancreatitis writing honestly about what it&amp;rsquo;s like that I feel I owe it to my past self to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my disability isn&amp;rsquo;t all of who I am: I am also a voracious reader and I make things with yarn. I&amp;rsquo;m also a JavaScript developer and I work for a really neat little company and it&amp;rsquo;s so &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, especially when compared with my prior job, which was actively making my health worse through an abusive manager who knew how to use the corporate bureaucracy to her benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think most of you reading this have noticed that I&amp;rsquo;m not using any part of my legal name on this site, although it is not difficult to discover. I am asking that this deliberate omission be respected as much as possible. I&amp;rsquo;m respecting your privacy by not using any cookies or other tracking technologies, so please respect mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally: welcome, world. I&amp;rsquo;m glad you&amp;rsquo;re here for this journey. Let&amp;rsquo;s have some fun.&lt;/p&gt;
