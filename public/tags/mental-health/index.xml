      <title>F Stands for Fungible</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started the process of mothballing my old site last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really hard to go through nearly 700 posts and unpublish them, leaving only the ones I&amp;rsquo;m planning on archiving on a static site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, really hard. Also hard was seeing people respond on Twitter to my statement a few days ago that I was shutting the site down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been, personally, a terrible few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my health, my career, and now I&amp;rsquo;m losing the vast majority of my social network. I am &lt;strong&gt;gutted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing harassment, silencing, and other kinds of abuse I&amp;rsquo;ve had to deal with over the nearly 10 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing there&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s just too much. I think that if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t felt so alone during last year&amp;rsquo;s Hugo season and if people with larger platforms on social media had done &lt;strong&gt;something&lt;/strong&gt; to defend me instead of choosing to let me be the tank for people&amp;rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the Hugo ballot&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that was a &lt;strong&gt;choice&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s not pretend that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. A lot of people knew how distressed I was by the bad faith arguments and the intimations that if I were a decent person, I&amp;rsquo;d have refused the nomination and they chose to say and do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then when I was brigaded by a bunch of leftier-than-thou jackasses after the Hugos&amp;ndash;again, no support. The fiction finalists who received abuse did get a lot of support, but when I posted in the finalist Slack that I was also being abused and the only other person who responded was another fan, well. That showed me who the SFF community finds importand and who they don&amp;rsquo;t. Shortly after, I quietly peaced out of the Slack since I no longer felt welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often joke that F doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand for fan, it stands for fungible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fungible&lt;/strong&gt;: being something (such as money or a commodity) of such a nature that one part or quantity may be replaced by another equal part or quantity in paying a debt or settling an account&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, fans like myself are seen by many pro writers and SMOFs as interchangeable cogs in the SFF community. And since we are fungible, when someone&amp;rsquo;s pushed aside or leaves, well, it&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal. Someone else will certainly come along. And I am definitely feeling disposable. Surely, there will come along someone else to fill my particular niche in the SFF community. I wish them luck, because they&amp;rsquo;re going to need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked a little bit about what I&amp;rsquo;ve had to deal with over the last ten years, let me make it explicit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;professional writers I thought were friends not only expressing relief that my essay didn&amp;rsquo;t win a Hugo, but the fact that it was nominated was a disgrace and saying so in a place where I could not only see it, but interact with it&amp;ndash;and their silence when I expressed my disappointment that they hadn&amp;rsquo;t bothered to hide it from me
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the comments on said post, some of which called my nomination the worst thing ever to happen to the Hugos, &lt;strong&gt;worse&lt;/strong&gt; than that time Harlan Ellison grabbed Connie Willis&amp;rsquo;s breast at the Hugo Awards Ceremony (there is video, you can look it up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aforementioned brigading by a bunch of leftier-than-thou jackasses on Twitter
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ringleaders have also made photoshopped memes of a post I deleted which they think is &lt;strong&gt;hilarious&lt;/strong&gt; (it&amp;rsquo;s not)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one of them also published a &amp;ldquo;poem&amp;rdquo; which was &amp;ldquo;inspired&amp;rdquo; by my deleted tweet and which also included the image and the tweet&amp;rsquo;s text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their creation of a &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo; in SFF that they can&amp;rsquo;t even define cogently which appears to have been created, in part, as a way to direct harassment towards me by getting the attention of professional writers with a significant platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ongoing defense of the subject of my essay, which is just weird because he&amp;rsquo;s a cis het white man with a swimming pool full of money: presumably everything they hate about capitalism and the power structures it sustains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having my work appropriated by professional non-fiction writers and not credited and when they were asked to credit me, made pathetic excuses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;endless accusations of whining, of jealousy, or of just wanting more traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;friendly advice&amp;rdquo; to be less blunt, to be nicer, to be quiet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;abusive comments calling me names, making fun of my appearance, telling me to die and/or kill myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doxxed 3 times in 2 years by trolls, Worldcon, and SFWA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legitimate criticism and engaging with my arguments? I have no problem with that. It&amp;rsquo;s when all this other stuff happens and happens because I&amp;rsquo;m saying things that people don&amp;rsquo;t like or don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear or because I don&amp;rsquo;t look the way they think I should (pray tell, how &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; I look?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s been ongoing for nearly 10 years and for the most part, the attacks are &lt;strong&gt;coming from inside the house&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it any wonder that I feel like I need a little space to re-grow and to find my voice again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m not sad about walking away: I am. I know that there are many people that I will lose touch with, since I won&amp;rsquo;t be interacting with them on Twitter or seeing them at conventions. I know that when I do start attending conventions again, I won&amp;rsquo;t be asked to be on programming anymore&amp;ndash;and I love being on panels and I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that I&amp;rsquo;m good at being on panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, eventually, I&amp;rsquo;ll feel comfortable shedding this pseudonym. For now, though, it&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I need.&lt;/p&gt;
