      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time over the last week falling into various rabbit holes. So many.
But one thing I keep coming back to is how, on my previous blog, I felt paralyzed by the weight of perfection. As if I were under so much scrutiny that the smallest mistake would cause a shitstorm.
This feeling was only exacerbated by the fact that when I did say something stupid on Twitter, a group of leftier than thou folks who enjoy brigading other people for the tiniest of ideological differences decided to brigade me.</description>

      <description>The spaghetti that is this site&amp;rsquo;s CSS is really something else&amp;ndash;to the point where using the override files just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because there&amp;rsquo;s so much stuff squirreled away in different places and it all takes different precedence.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made a kanban board for the things I want to do and a bunch of them include &amp;ldquo;refactor and consolidate X, Y, or Z.&amp;rdquo; I suspect that when I&amp;rsquo;m done, it&amp;rsquo;ll be an entirely new template.</description>

      <title>Trying to Post Images</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure out how to manage images; I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to do page bundles&amp;hellip;but I guess I am for now. Meh.
Annnnd, of course, I can&amp;rsquo;t get any of the theme&amp;rsquo;s built-in image shortcodes to actually respect my settings&amp;ndash;do I want my images linked? No, no I do not. And why the FUCK is it not rendering the CSS that at least hides my link formatting? I have it in the right order, it&amp;rsquo;s just straight-up ignoring me.</description>

      <description>Hello world!
While this is a new site, I am not new to blogging. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging one way or another since 1999, give or take. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of different sites over the years&amp;ndash;from Diaryland to Greymatter to Movable Type to LiveJournal to WordPress and now I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo because, to be quite honest, I am unhappy with the direction WordPress has taken their product&amp;ndash;they seem to assume that everyone wants to sell something and too often what&amp;rsquo;s for sale is a piece of someone&amp;rsquo;s soul.</description>
