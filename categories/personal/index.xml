      <description>The art of losing isnâ€™t hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.
 Four years ago today, I almost died.
And while I didn&amp;rsquo;t lose my life, I have had to master the art of losing nonetheless.
First The first thing I lost was my health. I&amp;rsquo;d been almost rudely healthy up to that point. I&amp;rsquo;d never been seriously sick beyond a couple of bouts of flu in my 20&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>I am just not feeling the thing this week.
I had a mere 2.5L drained last week1 and you&amp;rsquo;d think that would have helped and&amp;ndash;nope.
I feel bloated and I basically haven&amp;rsquo;t felt hungry so there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of forcing myself to eat and then I feel like I overate and it&amp;rsquo;s just not pleasant.
And I&amp;rsquo;m having weird random pain in my gut, but not enough to actually call my doctor or go to the ER about.</description>

      <description>It has been a week here.
I have:
 successfully wrangled custom radio button hover and focus states  the html radio buttons were offset from the custom ones and moving them helped the hover happen in the right places I am still mad at whoever originally coded the component, though   got a chunk of coding done for the mobile version of the site footer  the desktop version is good to go, but I have a few more bootstrap/flexbox things to figure out   helped a user regain access to their account using nothing more than an old photograph of their phone&amp;rsquo;s screen and a vague list of tasks.</description>

      <description>So here I am, in the wee hours of the morning, having frittered away the last 7 hours of my life on a few &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; updates to the site.
Except I kept thinking of new ways to do things or fixing errors with the style sheets to the point where, except for the general layout and the little cactus icon up there (which is going to be replaced soon, I swear), it&amp;rsquo;s basically a whole new theme.</description>

      <description>Did you know that I have not one, but two kanban boards? One for getting this site set up as I want it to be, and another for mothballing my old site.
They both have a LOT of things on them. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a lot of work.
But this evening, I knocked out a fair number of backend things I wanted to fix on this site, primarily with the CSS.</description>

      <title>F Stands for Fungible</title>

      <description>I started the process of mothballing my old site last night.
It was really hard to go through nearly 700 posts and unpublish them, leaving only the ones I&amp;rsquo;m planning on archiving on a static site.
Really, really hard. Also hard was seeing people respond on Twitter to my statement a few days ago that I was shutting the site down.
It&amp;rsquo;s been, personally, a terrible few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my health, my career, and now I&amp;rsquo;m losing the vast majority of my social network.</description>

      <title>Random Thoughts (June 9)</title>

      <description>Oof. I went in for my monthly-ish paracentesis yesterday morning.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what this is, here&amp;rsquo;s a handy explainer from Wikipedia.
First of all, I was up entirely too early for my own good. But it did mean I was able to take my meds and eat breakfast before having to leave for the hospital, so that&amp;rsquo;s something, yes?
Normally, it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad, but the doctor doing them yesterday was a resident and while she was very nice and perfectly competent, she was also still a resident, which means that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t as skilled as some of the doctors who have been there for years.</description>

      <description>The spaghetti that is this site&amp;rsquo;s CSS is really something else&amp;ndash;to the point where using the override files just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because there&amp;rsquo;s so much stuff squirreled away in different places and it all takes different precedence.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made a kanban board for the things I want to do and a bunch of them include &amp;ldquo;refactor and consolidate X, Y, or Z.&amp;rdquo; I suspect that when I&amp;rsquo;m done, it&amp;rsquo;ll be an entirely new template.</description>
