&lt;p>The art of losing isn’t hard to master;&lt;br>
so many things seem filled with the intent&lt;br>
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Four years ago today, I almost died.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And while I didn&amp;rsquo;t lose my life, I have had to &lt;a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47536/one-art">master the art of losing&lt;/a> nonetheless.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="first">First&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first thing I lost was my health. I&amp;rsquo;d been almost &lt;em>rudely&lt;/em> healthy up to that point. I&amp;rsquo;d never been seriously sick beyond a couple of bouts of flu in my 20&amp;rsquo;s. I had the occasional migraine and I&amp;rsquo;d generally get a cold or three in the winter, but in terms of physical illness, not much beyond the time I broke &lt;a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/smith-fracture">my wrist&lt;/a> when I was 9.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So dealing with a sudden onset situation that I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand beyond &amp;ldquo;you have &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/gallstone-pancreatitis">gallstone pancreatitis&lt;/a> but it should clear up pretty soon.&amp;rdquo; Spoiler: it did not. It was 3 months before it was &amp;ldquo;cleared up&amp;rdquo; and during that three months my pancreas decided it would be fun to digest itself. This is &lt;em>really really really&lt;/em> painful. And I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting enough pain medication.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/acute-pancreatitis/acute-pancreatitis-treatment">the complications&lt;/a> that Johns Hopkins lists for pancreatitis? I had &lt;em>all&lt;/em> of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And my medical team was composed of a bunch of surgical residents whose attending wasn&amp;rsquo;t supervising them properly. They discharged me multiple times when they should not; one time sending me home with &lt;em>55 pounds of fluid&lt;/em> and telling me that it would &amp;ldquo;resolve on its own&amp;rdquo; and spoiler: it did not. It put me into renal failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was only when my GI doctor came on the scene about two months into my illness that things started to change. He or someone from his office came by every day during daylight hours to talk to me and let me know what the plan was. He removed a 15 cm section of dead pancreas endoscopically&amp;ndash;and that was what really helped me to turn the corner and get well enough to be discharged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow. Necrotizing pancreatitis is incredibly painful and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wish it on my worst enemy. I take 13 different medications on a daily basis and they&amp;rsquo;re all essential to my continued existence on the plane of the living. I have eight different doctors that I see on a regular basis and all the required medical tests that go along with that. Between July 2018 and February 2021, I was hospitalized 18 times and most of those times were for at least a week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I really don&amp;rsquo;t have a pancreas anymore, I&amp;rsquo;m also on the diabetes merry-go-round,&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> which so far has involved a Durable Medical Equipment supplier (DME) sitting on the order for my insulin pump for &lt;em>five months&lt;/em> because they needed me to sign the financial responsibility form&amp;ndash;except they weren&amp;rsquo;t actually telling me that, they were telling me that they needed my insurance to provide a form that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist. I had to get a healthcare advocate involved to resolve the situation. I&amp;rsquo;ve had to call my mail order pharmacy multiple times to try to get them to send me my insulin. I had a &lt;em>different&lt;/em> DME demand a $700 up-front payment when I changed insurance because they didn&amp;rsquo;t take down the correct information when they validated my insurance and decided that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t fulfilled any of my deductible yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am still not resigned to the loss of my health, even though I know that my current level of wellness is about as good as it&amp;rsquo;s going to get.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="second">Second&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Then there was my career. When I got sick, my career was on the upswing: I was a recognized expert throughout the company in my specific niche, I was on a team that was developing the process for the spin-off company I was slated to go to, and things were just really, really good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I returned to work in November 2018 and for the next year, I worked to get back to full capacity. In September of 2019, I was transferred to a new manager, someone who had previously been a peer. I thought things would be fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then came my performance review for 2019, which she somehow managed to hijack despite only being my manager for &lt;em>one month&lt;/em> when I turned in my self-evaluation. She somehow managed to steamroll my former manager&amp;ndash;he was obviously pretty mad about it&amp;ndash;and somehow managed to give me the lowest possible performance rating but didn&amp;rsquo;t put any of the Serious Problems in writing and got around putting me on a PIP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me put it this way: the two years before I got sick, I&amp;rsquo;d gotten the highest possible performance review which was unheard of, so to go from that to the lowest in literally two years &lt;em>should&lt;/em> have raised a bunch of flags with HR, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My manager told me that 2020 would be a &amp;ldquo;reset&amp;rdquo; year for me and I was fool enough to believe her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In February 2020, I went to the on-site nurse with the paperwork from my doctors for ADA accommodations. My manager was notified and she was able to convene a shadow HR process called a &amp;ldquo;Medical Review Board&amp;rdquo; in which my need to work 2 days a week from home so I could conserve my energy for actually working instead of commuting was denied. At the time, there were three people in my role under this manager. One of them was a full time work from home employee in Canada. I am on the East Coast, and the other was in Iowa, at the same location as our manager. There was literally no need for me to be in the office except for the one in person meeting I had with IT each month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On February 27, 2020, I was told that I was being put on indefinite disability leave because my accommodations were an undue burden on the business. They essentially read the paperwork with the worst possible interpretation and did not look at how I&amp;rsquo;d been using my FMLA time outside of hospitalizations&amp;ndash;I was averaging 11 hours a month, which was not excessive. We all know what happened two weeks later&amp;ndash;everyone who could was working from home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And none of this was put in writing. So when I went to my doctors to ask them to revise my accommodations, it looked like &lt;em>I&lt;/em> initiated the change. I think, at this point, my manager was hoping I&amp;rsquo;d go out permanently on long term disability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, I was back to work by the beginning of April. And I started documenting &lt;em>everything&lt;/em> I was doing to achieve my goals. I was color coding every single hour I was working so I could show that I was actually working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought things were holding together and that I was making good progress&amp;ndash;and that&amp;rsquo;s what my manager was telling me while at the same time she was telling me that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have a monthly call with a peer to talk about instructional design, even though I was going to be responsible for writing a lot of technical documentation in 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was also doing the main part of my job, despite significant barriers around getting the data I needed because instead of letting me be in charge of the reconciliation from beginning to end, she made me rely on my two colleagues who were &lt;em>always&lt;/em> late or revising numbers from previous months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every time I told our manager that they were consistently putting me in a position where I was re-doing work multiple times, she emphasized how busy they were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every time I told her how difficult I was finding my workload, she would laugh and tell me hers was worse and then about a week later she&amp;rsquo;d find another special project to dump in my lap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I stopped mentioning it to her. I also stopped taking lunch breaks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was hospitalized three times between late September and mid-December for sepsis. Specifically, I had a bacterial infection in my blood. That&amp;rsquo;s incredibly serious. Me being out was a serious problem for my manager, as my two colleagues didn&amp;rsquo;t even try to pick up any of my tasks, even though I covered for them when they took vacations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when review time rolled around again, despite the eight pages of accomplishments, she rated me as low as possible &lt;em>again&lt;/em>. And again, didn&amp;rsquo;t provide any sort of substantive critique in writing. If my work was so poor all year long, why wasn&amp;rsquo;t I on a PIP? Why were there no written reprimands in my record?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then she &lt;em>lied to my face&lt;/em> about this making me vulnerable if layoffs were to happen. I was laid off a week later as part of a mass layoff, where nearly everyone else who was laid off was at least 10 years older than me and had at least 15 years of service more than I did and were making a lot more money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She gaslit me, she isolated me, she shifted the goalposts, she made constant appeals to authority, and the result was that she not only destroyed the reputation I&amp;rsquo;d spent most of two decades building but also my confidence in my own competence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I should have seen that &lt;a href="https://issendai.livejournal.com/572510.html">I was enmeshed in a sick system&lt;/a>, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t. And it took me most of last year to dig myself out of the hole I found myself in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="third">Third&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last year&amp;rsquo;s Hugo season and the aftermath was incredibly difficult, especially as it happened as I was in the middle of grieving both my health and career loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was a finalist because I wrote an essay that used Very Strong Language to call out a Venerable and Wealthy Older White Man for making the Hugo ceremony in 2020 about himself and how great things used to be instead of calling attention to the incredible slate of finalists and their accomplishments. And people put it on their nominating ballots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a segment of fandom that thought my essay had caused this Venerable Personage to cancel his plans to attend Worldcon in 2021 (not likely, his next book is like decades overdue at this point) and that was Very Bad. There was also some folks having the vapors over whether or not my nomination was a violation of the convention&amp;rsquo;s Code of Conduct (it wasn&amp;rsquo;t) to the point where they decided to try to drop the internet on my head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that would have been dealable, it truly would have, as the main actors where already people I knew to be assholes of the highest order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s what happened &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the Hugo ceremony that did me in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A large multinational company that has made a lot of things was the sponsor of the Red Carpet and there was a branded backdrop and a logo in the program book at the awards ceremony and they were thanked at the end of the ceremony along with the other sponsors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the things this company makes is missiles and drones. And they also help make various NASA programs happen. A &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of multinationals operate in different markets with products that both benefit and harm humanity. I made the mistake of mentioning on Twitter that one of my partners works at this multinational as part of a conversation between myself and two other people&amp;ndash;in other words, I didn&amp;rsquo;t just bust out with it on my timeline, it was buried in replies and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been surfaced by the algorithm for most folks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Folks looking to gain a bit of clout were doing indiscriminate searches for the name of the company and found my tweet and well, &lt;a href="https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online/">context collapsed on me&lt;/a>. I found myself under siege by the same group of individuals who brigaded another writer off Twitter in December 2021. I found my words being quoted derisively in a podcast that claimed to be about a non-existent trend they&amp;rsquo;d noticed in SFF and calling out two prominent and Very Online White Male SFF Writers as the problem when really they were using the non-existent trend and the engagement they knew they&amp;rsquo;d get from at least one of the writers mentioned by name as cover to continue to harass me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And no one stood up for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, that isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly true: other &lt;em>fans&lt;/em> stood up for me. But in terms of platform and reach, all the people with those things&amp;ndash;people who I&amp;rsquo;ve attended conventions with, broken bread with, paneled with&amp;ndash;none of them said anything. For the most part, they didn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;em>notice&lt;/em> that I was being harassed because the entire discussion was dominated by how stupid their non-existent trend is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And my heart broke into a million pieces when I realized how invisible I was because I was merely a &lt;em>fan&lt;/em>. And as everyone knows, we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;a href="https://peculiar.monster/posts/f-stands-for-fungible/">fungible&lt;/a> .&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="end">End&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am here. I am alive. I am filling in the holes in my life (and getting &lt;a href="https://wandering.shop/@eilatan/108681555961694221">new holes in my head&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet: I have so far to go&amp;ndash;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;It’s evident&lt;br>
the art of losing’s not too hard to master&lt;br>
though it may look like (&lt;em>Write&lt;/em> it!) like disaster.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The hospital I was in has a policy of not actively offering pain medication. You have to ask for it. They&amp;rsquo;re supposed to write on the patient info board when your last dose was, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen. So I spent a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of time in excruciating pain. Because, like, I was barely capable of talking for the first month I was sick because I&amp;rsquo;d had &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/subarachnoid-hemorrhage">a fucking &lt;em>stroke&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and they were expecting me to be able to &lt;em>tell time&lt;/em>?&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I had a mere 2.5L drained last week&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and you&amp;rsquo;d think that would have helped and&amp;ndash;nope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel bloated and I basically haven&amp;rsquo;t felt hungry so there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of forcing myself to eat and then I feel like I overate and it&amp;rsquo;s just not pleasant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I&amp;rsquo;m having weird random pain in my gut, but not enough to actually call my doctor or go to the ER about. It&amp;rsquo;s been a year and a half since I was hospitalized and my therapist has reminded me that this streak isn&amp;rsquo;t unbreakable, alas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also started a new blood thinner, Xarelto. I&amp;rsquo;d been on Eliquis since 2018 and then my prescription insurance (everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite, Caremark/CVS) decided to take it off the formulary and require a prior authorization so my doctor just switched me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The funny thing is that because of all the hospitalizations I&amp;rsquo;ve had, I have one heck of a stockpile of medication, so I had 6 months of Eliquis to use up before I started the Xarelto. And I can tell the difference: I&amp;rsquo;d bleed a bit more than I&amp;rsquo;d like when I got a cut or scratch, but the Xarelto? Hooboy. I accidentally scratched my arm the other day and bled all over two shirts before it stopped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I was scratching my leg yesterday and accidentally hit a couple of scabs and actual blood dripping down my leg happened, so I stuck a band-aid on and when I took it off before bed last night, I looked at it and there was quite a bit of blood happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And to continue on the blood theme, I had to get labs done in advance of my seeing my specialist in Center City next week,&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and I decided to go to the hospital instead of Labcorp. Which actually worked out well: I told the phlebotamist that I was a hard stick and she proceeded to find the one good vein in my arm and get it on the first try and she wanted to know who&amp;rsquo;d told me I was a hard stick. My answer? &amp;ldquo;Every other phlebotamist in this hospital and all of the ones at LabCorp, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve a band-aid on my arm and I&amp;rsquo;m a little scared to take it off, even though it&amp;rsquo;s been nearly 7 hours. I gotta say, though, it was &lt;em>nice&lt;/em> to be able to get in and out of the lab like a normal person. Instead of having every phlebotamist in the place taking a (literal) stab at me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But. I feel like hot garbage and I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking too many naps and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do about it. I&amp;rsquo;ll figure something out, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.&lt;/p>
&lt;section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

&lt;li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t very much, I was regularly getting 6 to 8 liters drained a year and a half ago.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s going to tell me that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing more to be done and to hold the course; why I have to spend an hour and a half in the car and $20 on parking to be told that, I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>successfully wrangled custom radio button hover and focus states
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the html radio buttons were offset from the custom ones and moving them helped the hover happen in the right places&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am still mad at whoever originally coded the component, though&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>got a chunk of coding done for the mobile version of the site footer
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the desktop version is good to go, but I have a few more bootstrap/flexbox things to figure out&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>helped a user regain access to their account using nothing more than an old photograph of their phone&amp;rsquo;s screen and a vague list of tasks. I felt like a fucking wizard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>installed &lt;a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty&lt;/a> to use for the Pretty Terrible archive
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it&amp;rsquo;s mostly done, but I&amp;rsquo;m still messing with the css and attempting to get some data to show up the way I&amp;rsquo;d like it to&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also need to pull the images that the posts I&amp;rsquo;m keeping need&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>managed to write an &lt;code>npm start&lt;/code> script for the 11ty site which launches the local server and runs sass so I can map color hex codes to variables along with other things
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>this makes me happy, because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to change colors uses sass variables&lt;/li>
&lt;li>also, the easier the command is for me to launch something on the command line, the happier I am&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m now trying to figure out how to do this for some of my personal Habitica scripts&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fiddled with the template here a tiny bit, but not as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like&lt;/li>
&lt;li>thought about changing the template here, but the sunk cost fallacy has come into play so I don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/li>
&lt;li>finished re-reading Katherine Addison&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>The Goblin Emperor&lt;/em> and I&amp;rsquo;m now re-reading &lt;em>Witness for the Dead&lt;/em> and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably re-read &lt;em>Grief of Stones&lt;/em>, too&amp;ndash;I have an essay started about that one, so I do want to be sure of the themes, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>beat Tetris Effects Journey mode on Beginner&lt;/li>
&lt;li>called the local hospital system to make sure that all my bills are accounted for in the billing system and figured out how to access my account online; they keep changing systems (MAKE UP YOUR MINDS, PEOPLE) and access is a constant struggle and they are constantly sending me paper bills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>paid a lingering Labcorp bill&lt;/li>
&lt;li>paid my therapist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>paid the household bills and balanced the household budget
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>this included re-registering my car and filing the deed which came in the mail since my car is all paid off now&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>messaged my GI doctor about medical marijuana&lt;/li>
&lt;li>did a bunch of knitting
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I had to more or less rip out a mostly-complete project that had been in hibernation for at least five years due to breaks in the yarn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It was weird, the breaks were &lt;em>only&lt;/em> in the gray yarn and not the variegated, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what happened&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BUT on the plus side, I&amp;rsquo;ve done way more of this designer&amp;rsquo;s patterns in the time between putting this project in hibernation and now, so the bits I was struggling with that made me shove this in a bag and forget about it aren&amp;rsquo;t really an issue anymore&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I still have a few things to do today. I have an appointment for a paracentesis this afternoon. I was planning on working between therapy and shortly before I had to leave, but I woke up this morning feeling like utter garbage so bailed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Miles has been very attentive&amp;ndash;he knows when I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling well and will pester me to go to bed. I think that&amp;rsquo;s what his attentiveness this morning was about, but he has since given up and is napping on his perch by the front window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also gave in and purchased an Amazon spy speaker. My SIL has them in her house and it was really convenient to just be able to ask it to play music or to tell me when an hour had passed. Yes, I know this is how they get you. I am probably going to get a couple more on Prime Day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weekend plans include more fussing with 11ty and the PT archive and probably more work on this site&amp;rsquo;s template. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to go all out and knit, play Animal Crossing, and do some laundry. I know, my life is so exciting!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Messing Around</title><link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/messing-around/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 00:38:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/messing-around/</guid><description>&lt;p>So here I am, in the wee hours of the morning, having frittered away the last 7 hours of my life on a few &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; updates to the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except I kept thinking of new ways to do things or fixing errors with the style sheets to the point where, except for the general layout and the little cactus icon up there (which is going to be replaced soon, I swear), it&amp;rsquo;s basically a whole new theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s held together with duct tape and bubblegum at this point, but it &lt;em>works&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I made a new &lt;code>theme.toml&lt;/code> file and claimed it as my own&amp;ndash;obviously, giving credit to the previous developers who worked on it within the file. It&amp;rsquo;s nowhere &lt;em>near&lt;/em> ready to publish and honestly? I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I want to. It&amp;rsquo;s missing a lot of the things that people look for: no search, no emoji support, no pagination between posts,&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> no analytics, and probably a bunch of other things as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three of the four things on that list are coming (search, emoji support, and pagination) and I will not use analytics. I might put some parameters in for Fathom, because they do have a strong privacy policy, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll use them myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I added a couple of things that other folks probably don&amp;rsquo;t think or care about: a clear statement of what&amp;rsquo;s going on here with regards to privacy and an acknowledgment that I reside on the traditional lands of the Lenapehoking people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s now a full text RSS feed, praise Jesus and pass the mashed potatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other thing I did today was spend $2,236 and change on getting my car&amp;rsquo;s 30,000 mile service and front and back brake repairs. We&amp;rsquo;re going on a short road trip next week and it needed to be done. The Blubaru is 5 years old and only has 28,000 miles on her&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m expecting to drive her for another 10 years, at least.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then I went to pick up a prescription (I have been to CVS 4 times in the last 2 weeks, because can they sync up the 4 things I pick up from them in person? no, no they cannot) which cost me the princely sum of $0.39. So that&amp;rsquo;s something, I guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also spent a few hours this afternoon&amp;ndash;while waiting to hear from the dealership about the car&amp;ndash;working on my mosaic knitting project. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and if I apply myself, I may be able to finish before we head out of town&amp;ndash;which means I could potentially cast on for something else. Or get out one of my many WIPs. I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll see what I may be in the mood to bring along with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomorrow is laundry and putting together a packing list and perhaps attempting to work my way through the rest of the to do list that I&amp;rsquo;ve been ignoring for a good chunk of the week (my weeks start on Monday).&lt;/p>

One for getting this site set up as I want it to be, and another for mothballing my old site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They both have a LOT of things on them. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a lot of work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this evening, I knocked out a fair number of backend things I wanted to fix on this site, primarily with the CSS. I figured out what all the different files were doing, removed the parts that were irrelevant (goodbye stupid jquery menu on mobile), and did my various imports in a way that made sense for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also replaced a few things with links to CDNs instead of hosting the entire content here&amp;ndash;that allows me to keep up to date with the most current version of things but it does add a vulnerability in case those CDNs go down. They&amp;rsquo;re mostly for things like some of the icons and the CSS frameword the original author chose to use. If the CDNs do go down, things will degrade gracefully until they come back up again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a completely different topic:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Folks on Twitter have been so kind and I wrote yesterday about the &lt;a href="https://peculiar.monster/posts/f-stands-for-fungible">reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to distance myself from fandom&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to give an example of the sort of lifting of phrasing/ideas in such a way that it&amp;rsquo;s clear that my work was the inspiration&amp;ndash;I ran across this just last night:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote on August 1, 2020:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Martin made the decision to first mention her unprecedented accomplishment of winning the Best Novel three years in a row–-no one else of any race or gender has ever accomplished a Best Novel hat trick–-and then attempt to undermine it&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And in the the essay I ran across yesterday, that author wrote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Martin has also been criticized for disrespecting the award winners, mispronouncing names and undercutting accomplishments like N. K. Jemisin’s “hat trick” of three Hugo awards for best novel in as many years,&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not a word for word lifting, but as far as I know, I am the person who first referred to Jemisin&amp;rsquo;s historic achievement as a &amp;ldquo;hat trick,&amp;rdquo; and I immedately followed it with Martin&amp;rsquo;s attempt to undermine it. (I included the content of his undermining attempt, too.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this piece, the author uses undercut before mentioning Jemisin&amp;rsquo;s achievement. I know that undercut &lt;strong>isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong> the same word, but it can be used interchangeably with undermine in this context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not linking the essay in question because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stir up trouble, but this is the sort of low-grade theft I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with for the last decade. My essays are good enough to read and gain inspiration from, but not good enough to cite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll also note that apart my words, the author did an excellent job both sourcing and citing their sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please think about why that may be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the aftermath of my post, I was accused of posting for clout, for hating George, for using indecent language, for being jealous, fo being all sorts of things I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You know why I posted it? I was angry. I was angry that someone with the stature of George R.R. Martin couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to take the time to learn how to say people&amp;rsquo;s names, but took the time to figure out which hat he was going to wear for which segment and which action figures he was going to put on display. I was angry that he made the entire ceremony about how good the past was, with no acknowledgement that the past SUCKED for a lot of people and still SUCKS for them STILL. I was angry on behalf of my friends and colleagues who had turned on the ceremony excited to see their works celebrated and who instead THAT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeah, I swore. And yeah, I used a metaphor involving the sun. And yeeting people into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I happened to be the first person to post any sort of response online. Which is the only reason it got the audience that it did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, imagine, how I felt afterwards, being accused of everything I wasn&amp;rsquo;t and also knowing that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t defend myself. It was like all those writing workshops all over again: I had to sit and take the abuse in silence. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking the abuse in (relative) silence for nearly two years now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s just been a lot. And I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to be writing a lot about my trauma here&amp;ndash;not just with regards to fandom, but also about my childhood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ve been forewarned.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>F Stands for Fungible</title><link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/f-stands-for-fungible/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 16:55:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/f-stands-for-fungible/</guid><description>&lt;p>I started the process of mothballing my old site last night.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was really hard to go through nearly 700 posts and unpublish them, leaving only the ones I&amp;rsquo;m planning on archiving on a static site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Really, really hard. Also hard was seeing people respond on Twitter to my statement a few days ago that I was shutting the site down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been, personally, a terrible few years. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my health, my career, and now I&amp;rsquo;m losing the vast majority of my social network. I am &lt;strong>gutted&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ongoing harassment, silencing, and other kinds of abuse I&amp;rsquo;ve had to deal with over the nearly 10 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing there&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s just too much. I think that if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t felt so alone during last year&amp;rsquo;s Hugo season and if people with larger platforms on social media had done &lt;strong>something&lt;/strong> to defend me instead of choosing to let me be the tank for people&amp;rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the Hugo ballot&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because that was a &lt;strong>choice&lt;/strong>. Let&amp;rsquo;s not pretend that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. A lot of people knew how distressed I was by the bad faith arguments and the intimations that if I were a decent person, I&amp;rsquo;d have refused the nomination and they chose to say and do nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then when I was brigaded by a bunch of leftier-than-thou jackasses after the Hugos&amp;ndash;again, no support. The fiction finalists who received abuse did get a lot of support, but when I posted in the finalist Slack that I was also being abused and the only other person who responded was another fan, well. That showed me who the SFF community finds importand and who they don&amp;rsquo;t. Shortly after, I quietly peaced out of the Slack since I no longer felt welcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I often joke that F doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand for fan, it stands for fungible.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>fungible&lt;/strong>: being something (such as money or a commodity) of such a nature that one part or quantity may be replaced by another equal part or quantity in paying a debt or settling an account&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That is, fans like myself are seen by many pro writers and SMOFs as interchangeable cogs in the SFF community. And since we are fungible, when someone&amp;rsquo;s pushed aside or leaves, well, it&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal. Someone else will certainly come along. And I am definitely feeling disposable. Surely, there will come along someone else to fill my particular niche in the SFF community. I wish them luck, because they&amp;rsquo;re going to need it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve talked a little bit about what I&amp;rsquo;ve had to deal with over the last ten years, let me make it explicit:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>professional writers I thought were friends not only expressing relief that my essay didn&amp;rsquo;t win a Hugo, but the fact that it was nominated was a disgrace and saying so in a place where I could not only see it, but interact with it&amp;ndash;and their silence when I expressed my disappointment that they hadn&amp;rsquo;t bothered to hide it from me
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the comments on said post, some of which called my nomination the worst thing ever to happen to the Hugos, &lt;strong>worse&lt;/strong> than that time Harlan Ellison grabbed Connie Willis&amp;rsquo;s breast at the Hugo Awards Ceremony (there is video, you can look it up)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>aforementioned brigading by a bunch of leftier-than-thou jackasses on Twitter
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the ringleaders have also made photoshopped memes of a post I deleted which they think is &lt;strong>hilarious&lt;/strong> (it&amp;rsquo;s not)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one of them also published a &amp;ldquo;poem&amp;rdquo; which was &amp;ldquo;inspired&amp;rdquo; by my deleted tweet and which also included the image and the tweet&amp;rsquo;s text&lt;/li>
&lt;li>their creation of a &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo; in SFF that they can&amp;rsquo;t even define cogently which appears to have been created, in part, as a way to direct harassment towards me by getting the attention of professional writers with a significant platform&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ongoing defense of the subject of my essay, which is just weird because he&amp;rsquo;s a cis het white man with a swimming pool full of money: presumably everything they hate about capitalism and the power structures it sustains&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>having my work appropriated by professional non-fiction writers and not credited and when they were asked to credit me, made pathetic excuses&lt;/li>
&lt;li>endless accusations of whining, of jealousy, or of just wanting more traffic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;friendly advice&amp;rdquo; to be less blunt, to be nicer, to be quiet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>abusive comments calling me names, making fun of my appearance, telling me to die and/or kill myself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>doxxed 3 times in 2 years by trolls, Worldcon, and SFWA&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Legitimate criticism and engaging with my arguments? I have no problem with that. It&amp;rsquo;s when all this other stuff happens and happens because I&amp;rsquo;m saying things that people don&amp;rsquo;t like or don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear or because I don&amp;rsquo;t look the way they think I should (pray tell, how &lt;strong>should&lt;/strong> I look?).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s been ongoing for nearly 10 years and for the most part, the attacks are &lt;strong>coming from inside the house&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is it any wonder that I feel like I need a little space to re-grow and to find my voice again?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m not sad about walking away: I am. I know that there are many people that I will lose touch with, since I won&amp;rsquo;t be interacting with them on Twitter or seeing them at conventions. I know that when I do start attending conventions again, I won&amp;rsquo;t be asked to be on programming anymore&amp;ndash;and I love being on panels and I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that I&amp;rsquo;m good at being on panels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps, eventually, I&amp;rsquo;ll feel comfortable shedding this pseudonym. For now, though, it&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I need.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Current Feelings Towards SFF Fandom</title><link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/sff-feelings-mood/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 13:25:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/sff-feelings-mood/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="acnh-big-mood.png" alt="An Animal Crossing New Horizons character sitting in a cheap lawn chair in the evening with a tray table full of empty alcohol bottles next to them.

I went in for my monthly-ish paracentesis yesterday morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what this is, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracentesis">a handy explainer from Wikipedia&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, I was up entirely too early for my own good. But it did mean I was able to take my meds and eat breakfast before having to leave for the hospital, so that&amp;rsquo;s something, yes?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normally, it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad, but the doctor doing them yesterday was a resident and while she was very nice and perfectly competent, she was also still a &lt;em>resident&lt;/em>, which means that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t as skilled as some of the doctors who have been there for years. And I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a tough case&amp;ndash;I get tapped on my left side, not the right, and I&amp;rsquo;m not a high volume person anymore (thank God&amp;ndash;that&amp;rsquo;s 5L or more).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I got home, I took my pain meds and went directly to bed. I ended up spending most of the day in bed, which meant I didn&amp;rsquo;t get good sleep last night&amp;ndash;which means I was up at 4:30 am this morning for a few hours (I was able to see the day restart on Animal Crossing, which I&amp;rsquo;d never done before, so yay?) and then was able to get back to sleep for a couple of hours and then I was up for the day. And I&amp;rsquo;m still in a bit of pain. Boo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My code editor&amp;ndash;Atom&amp;ndash;is being sunset at the end of the year, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking for alternatives. I&amp;rsquo;m leaning towards Sublime Text and Sublime Merge over VSCode, mainly because I feel like VSCode is bloated as all get out. It makes me cranky, though, because I &lt;em>finally&lt;/em> got a good workflow going in Atom and managed to learn a bunch of keyboard shortcuts and now I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to learn different ones. Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to rework the colors here, but maybe this weekend? There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of weirdness in the CSS&amp;ndash;like the theme&amp;rsquo;s author made a &lt;em>separate&lt;/em> CSS file for each partial template and is importing them into the main CSS which is, just, weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is mostly a post to make a post. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about SFF fandom and how Certain Parties just seem so intent on stirring shit up with their ridiculous s&amp;mdash;-core concept, something which defines a &lt;em>negative&lt;/em> and not what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, which is a lot of body horror. I don&amp;rsquo;t think SFF necessarily needs more body horror, thanks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, these people don&amp;rsquo;t actually seem to be very widely read in SFF and therefore think that no one is reading or writing &amp;ldquo;dark&amp;rdquo; fiction and well, that&amp;rsquo;s a crock of shit. And they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>very&lt;/em> intent on lionizing GRRM for some reason. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of thinking about this whole thing for the past few months and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping, at some point, to be able to write something coherent about it as opposed to what I&amp;rsquo;ve just written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now? It&amp;rsquo;s time for me to get to work! Work! How glorious it is to be able to work at a job that I really enjoy and that I seem to be reasonably good at? I mean, still a newbie developer, but I&amp;rsquo;m learning and seem to be learning fast enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Better Colors?</title><link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/better-colors/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 23:21:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/better-colors/</guid><description>&lt;p>The spaghetti that is this site&amp;rsquo;s CSS is really something else&amp;ndash;to the point where using the override files just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because there&amp;rsquo;s so much stuff squirreled away in different places and it all takes different precedence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a kanban board for the things I want to do and a bunch of them include &amp;ldquo;refactor and consolidate X, Y, or Z.&amp;rdquo; I suspect that when I&amp;rsquo;m done, it&amp;rsquo;ll be an entirely new template.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not thrilled with the colors and I think I need to rework them so there are more constrast colors and less four different shades of pinky-purple. But at least I managed to fix the damn fonts and hyphenation. The previous choices were&amp;ndash;choices. Yes. That&amp;rsquo;s the word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a two hour nap with Miles this afternoon. He&amp;rsquo;s the only cat I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been able to nap with&amp;ndash;I can say to him, &amp;ldquo;Miles, want to come take a nap?&amp;rdquo; and he&amp;rsquo;ll get up from wherever he&amp;rsquo;s at (on a cat tree, in a sunbeam) to follow me into the bedroom and wait relatively patiently for me to get my glasses off and the white noise on and get into bed&amp;ndash;and then he&amp;rsquo;ll hop up and settle himself on my chest and we&amp;rsquo;ll both sleep and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to not suffocate in his fur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I&amp;rsquo;m having a bad body day, he&amp;rsquo;ll often herd me to bed to take a nap. It&amp;rsquo;s like he &lt;em>knows&lt;/em> somehow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at night&amp;ndash;he sometimes sleeps at the foot of the bed at night, but he prefers other places to do his important cat business overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s a funny cat, but he&amp;rsquo;s my cat and I love him so much. He&amp;rsquo;s the very best black cat I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. (I really can&amp;rsquo;t quantify which cat&amp;rsquo;s the best of the best, they&amp;rsquo;ve all been great in different ways&amp;ndash;all very different personalities.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Ridiculous Day</title><link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/ridiculous-day/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 22:02:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/ridiculous-day/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s been a day of a lot of ridiculous all over the board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First off, the day started with therapy. Which wasn&amp;rsquo;t ridiculous, but it was 8:15 in the morning so there&amp;rsquo;s a certain degree of waaaah going on (every week, my appointment is at 8:15 am every week) just in general. Talked about EMDR a little bit to help me deal with my DESNOS/cPTSD (the &lt;em>name&lt;/em> of the thing is shifting: DESNOS is the name in the current edition of the DSM, cPTSD is what it&amp;rsquo;s generally known by these days). I&amp;rsquo;m really good at masking, so it&amp;rsquo;s often hard to tell when I&amp;rsquo;m losing my shit or really anxious orm, to be honest, even when I&amp;rsquo;m really depressed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After therapy, I had to scoot along to my appointment with the PA at the Infectious Disease practice that&amp;rsquo;s been following me since 2018. They&amp;rsquo;re all great and the doctor who initially treated me, I&amp;rsquo;m convinced is the one who helped turn the tide for me&amp;ndash;not just by treating the massive infection I had as a result of the necrosis happening in my abdomen, but by advocating for me with other hospital staff. Sadly, they&amp;rsquo;re going to be following me for likely the rest of my life: I had sepsis 3 times in the fourth quarter of 2020&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, so I&amp;rsquo;m on prophylactic oral antibiotics and need regular check-ins with them to make sure everything&amp;rsquo;s still fine. I did graduate from every 3 months to every 6 months for appointments, though!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But see, I was sneaky and I took a little time before therapy and before my Infectious Disease appointment to mess around here; I decided last night that the theme I&amp;rsquo;d initially chosen was too complex both for my needs and for my level of ability, so I decided on Cactus as something a bit more streamlined if less flashy (I do like the color-changing cactus icon but I am going to replace it with something else). So I attempted to clone it in as a git submodule and I &lt;em>really&lt;/em> shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done that&amp;ndash;I have terrible luck with the git submodule at work, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I thought this was any different. Like I fucked things up so badly the site wouldn&amp;rsquo;t deploy and I had to go to &lt;a href="https://ohshitgit.com/">Oh Shit, Git!?!&lt;/a> to find what I needed to fix things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But fix them I did and after I got home it was to work! In the spare room!&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I do every day is review the to do list I (hopefully) made the day before&amp;ndash;I only work 5-6 hours a day, so I have to make sure those hours count. By the time I got settled in and done with the list review, it was time for a meeting. The meeting ran short, so I started on my top task: pulling user IDs out of the beta database so we could award beta testers a special achievement in production. The PR for the achievement is still in queue to be deployed, but I wanted to have all the user IDs and usernames and email addresses in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;and it took me all fucking afternoon. Because our database is MongoDB, which is noSQL which means there are no relations between the different collections (they&amp;rsquo;re not even tables, they&amp;rsquo;re just JSON files, sob) and because the beta test involved testing group functionality and both parties and guilds fall under groups&amp;hellip;and while you can only be in one party, you can be in as many guilds as you want. I only had the email address of one person per guild and needed to be able to award the achievement to everyone in the group that participated. And I&amp;rsquo;m not great at queryng MongoDB because the operands and syntax are just so foreign to me after so many years of working with a terribly design SQL database. So it took me all fucking afternoon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With an intermission where I checked on the status of my insulin prescription, which was supposed to be released from hold earlier this week and was not. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get it filled for the better part of a week&amp;ndash;I was able to get all my other prescriptions transferred to my new insurance and filled with no problem, bu the insulin has been terrible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, there was no response from my doctor&amp;rsquo;s office when CVS/caremark (OF COURSE IT&amp;rsquo;S THEM) contacted them for &lt;em>either&lt;/em> a new prescription &lt;em>or&lt;/em> a prior authorization&amp;ndash;nevermind that those are &lt;em>two completely different things&lt;/em>, why there&amp;rsquo;s the same message for both statuses on the customer end is beyond my understanding but most things on the CVS/caremark website are beyond my understanding. Like why is it so slow? Why do the apps suck so much?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow, I digress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to contact my doctor&amp;rsquo;s office three times before someone got back to me&amp;ndash;I sent a message, which was never forwarded, I called and spoke to someone who claimed that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t sent a message and that they hadn&amp;rsquo;t received anything from CVS/caremark, and then I finally sent a third message which did make it through. And it turned out that a prior authorization was needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a medication without which I will &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_ketoacidosis">&lt;strong>&lt;em>DIE A TERRIBLE DEATH&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I received a robo-call and then a form letter from my insurer informing me that they were going to allow me to continue to live by granting me a prior authoriztion for my insulin until I am 65, at which point I suppose I become Medicare&amp;rsquo;s problem. If there still is a Medicare in 2039.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So on Tuesday, I called to see about getting the prescription off hold and filled. The person I spoke to assured me that she had accomplished this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that CVS/caremark is good at is sending email. I got a number of emails informing me about all sorts of things over the last two days, but nothing about my insulin. So I decided to take a small break from work and check the status online. It was still on hold. I called. The prior authorization had not yet made its way through the system to the point where my prescription could be filled. The rep told me I needed a prior authorization and I told him that I would be happy to tell him the reference number on the letter I received from my insurer. He did a bit more checking and lo, there it was. And now it&amp;rsquo;s supposedly free to be filled and shipped to me next week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let us now take a moment to contemplate how this ridiculous system hurts people who can&amp;rsquo;t manage their insurer or CVS/caremark&amp;rsquo;s website either because they&amp;rsquo;re hard to use or because lack of internet access. How it hurts people who can&amp;rsquo;t make phone call after phone call to sort things out. How this hurts people who don&amp;rsquo;t know that they need to keep that piece of paper they got in the mail. How this hurts people with various kinds of disabilities who have to rely on their caregivers to navigate this system on their behalf. On all sorts of people, really. I am &lt;em>lucky&lt;/em> that I am able to go Full Karen if needed to get this shit taken care of&amp;ndash;not everyone can. And not everyone is as persistent or as stubborn as I am.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My stubbornness has served me well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And after that delightful intermission, I went back to work. I finally got the data completed so we will be able to grant folks their achievement when it goes live and then I decided it would be fun to work on this site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot I want to do to move things around to my liking&amp;ndash;the icon, the colors, the font and spacing&amp;ndash;but the structure of this theme is significantly more simple than the other one and I was even able to leave a helpful comment on one of the issues on GitHub about the tags page. Even though it looks like the developer has abandoned the project&amp;ndash;there are two open PRs to fix the same problem, but neither of them actually fix it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But you know, it keeps me out of trouble. And only scares me a little bit, that I might be turning into my father, who spent most of my childhood and well into my adulthood sitting in front of a computer, coding. (In other words, I come by this naturally. Or something.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things I want to do, in no particular order:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>New image in the header&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Previous/Next links on individual pages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Post wordcount because why not?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Removing the &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo; menu link on the home page, golly that drives me up a wall&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New font and colors
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Get rid of the embedded font files, who does that in the year of our Lord 2022 just find a nice Google font and let it goooooo&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emoji support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stripping out all the code I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use, like the comments and the jquery and the analytics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Combining desktop and mobile page navigation into one file&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Killing the image gallery deader than a doornail&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Looking into adding support for &lt;a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb&lt;/a> stuff!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And here&amp;rsquo;s your reward: a picture of the first roses of the season. This a polyanthus variety called &amp;ldquo;The Fairy,&amp;rdquo; the blooms are only about 1&amp;quot; in diameter and there are loads of them. They don&amp;rsquo;t smell, though, and they&amp;rsquo;re prickly as all get out. I love them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was hospitalized for a week and was sent home with a PICC line for at-home IV antibiotics each time, which required time to administer and a weekly visit from a nurse to change the dressing. Before I had this series of hospitalizations, I was&amp;ndash;according to my former manager&amp;ndash;on track to achieve my goals for 2020. Afterwards, though, she characterized me in my annual review as &amp;ldquo;unreliable&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;inconsistent.&amp;rdquo; Hmmmmm.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Huh. Apparently the way the scientists were first able to extract and purify insulin for use in people was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin#Extraction_and_purification">by giving dogs what amounted to surgically induced pancreatic necrosis&lt;/a>.
