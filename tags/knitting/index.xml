Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Annnnd, of course, I can&amp;rsquo;t get any of the theme&amp;rsquo;s built-in image shortcodes to actually &lt;em>respect&lt;/em> my settings&amp;ndash;do I want my images linked? No, no I do not. And why the FUCK is it not rendering the CSS that at least hides my link formatting? I have it in the right order, it&amp;rsquo;s just straight-up &lt;em>ignoring&lt;/em> me. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think I need to find another, simpler theme to work with. This one is awfully finicky and NOT GOOD at respecting my choices. Which is why I wanted to get away from the WordPress ecosystem in the first place: to have better choices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow. Enjoy this image of my African violet blooming&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve never had one bloom before, and I&amp;rsquo;ve even managed to keep it alive for over a year. That&amp;rsquo;s a victory, for sure. The second image is of my current knitting project, &lt;a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/mutual-admiration-society">Mutual Admiration Society&lt;/a> (Rav link, sorry), which I bought as a kit eons ago. It uses a technique new to me, mosaic knitting, which is slipping stitches on every row with two alternating colors. It looks a lot harder than it actually is. The gray speckled yarn is Miss Babs&amp;rsquo;s Yowza and it is incredible to work with&amp;ndash;I would love to make a sweater with this stuff, it&amp;rsquo;s so round and bouncy and nice to work with.&lt;/p>
