      <description>So here I am, in the wee hours of the morning, having frittered away the last 7 hours of my life on a few &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; updates to the site.
Except I kept thinking of new ways to do things or fixing errors with the style sheets to the point where, except for the general layout and the little cactus icon up there (which is going to be replaced soon, I swear), it&amp;rsquo;s basically a whole new theme.</description>

      <description>Oof. I went in for my monthly-ish paracentesis yesterday morning.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what this is, here&amp;rsquo;s a handy explainer from Wikipedia.
First of all, I was up entirely too early for my own good. But it did mean I was able to take my meds and eat breakfast before having to leave for the hospital, so that&amp;rsquo;s something, yes?
Normally, it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad, but the doctor doing them yesterday was a resident and while she was very nice and perfectly competent, she was also still a resident, which means that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t as skilled as some of the doctors who have been there for years.</description>
