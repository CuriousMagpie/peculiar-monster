&lt;p>Except I kept thinking of new ways to do things or fixing errors with the style sheets to the point where, except for the general layout and the little cactus icon up there (which is going to be replaced soon, I swear), it&amp;rsquo;s basically a whole new theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s held together with duct tape and bubblegum at this point, but it &lt;em>works&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I made a new &lt;code>theme.toml&lt;/code> file and claimed it as my own&amp;ndash;obviously, giving credit to the previous developers who worked on it within the file. It&amp;rsquo;s nowhere &lt;em>near&lt;/em> ready to publish and honestly? I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I want to. It&amp;rsquo;s missing a lot of the things that people look for: no search, no emoji support, no pagination between posts,&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> no analytics, and probably a bunch of other things as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three of the four things on that list are coming (search, emoji support, and pagination) and I will not use analytics. I might put some parameters in for Fathom, because they do have a strong privacy policy, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll use them myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I added a couple of things that other folks probably don&amp;rsquo;t think or care about: a clear statement of what&amp;rsquo;s going on here with regards to privacy and an acknowledgment that I reside on the traditional lands of the Lenapehoking people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s now a full text RSS feed, praise Jesus and pass the mashed potatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other thing I did today was spend $2,236 and change on getting my car&amp;rsquo;s 30,000 mile service and front and back brake repairs. We&amp;rsquo;re going on a short road trip next week and it needed to be done. The Blubaru is 5 years old and only has 28,000 miles on her&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m expecting to drive her for another 10 years, at least.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then I went to pick up a prescription (I have been to CVS 4 times in the last 2 weeks, because can they sync up the 4 things I pick up from them in person? no, no they cannot) which cost me the princely sum of $0.39. So that&amp;rsquo;s something, I guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also spent a few hours this afternoon&amp;ndash;while waiting to hear from the dealership about the car&amp;ndash;working on my mosaic knitting project. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and if I apply myself, I may be able to finish before we head out of town&amp;ndash;which means I could potentially cast on for something else. Or get out one of my many WIPs. I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll see what I may be in the mood to bring along with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomorrow is laundry and putting together a packing list and perhaps attempting to work my way through the rest of the to do list that I&amp;rsquo;ve been ignoring for a good chunk of the week (my weeks start on Monday).&lt;/p>

I went in for my monthly-ish paracentesis yesterday morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what this is, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracentesis">a handy explainer from Wikipedia&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, I was up entirely too early for my own good. But it did mean I was able to take my meds and eat breakfast before having to leave for the hospital, so that&amp;rsquo;s something, yes?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normally, it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad, but the doctor doing them yesterday was a resident and while she was very nice and perfectly competent, she was also still a &lt;em>resident&lt;/em>, which means that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t as skilled as some of the doctors who have been there for years. And I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a tough case&amp;ndash;I get tapped on my left side, not the right, and I&amp;rsquo;m not a high volume person anymore (thank God&amp;ndash;that&amp;rsquo;s 5L or more).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I got home, I took my pain meds and went directly to bed. I ended up spending most of the day in bed, which meant I didn&amp;rsquo;t get good sleep last night&amp;ndash;which means I was up at 4:30 am this morning for a few hours (I was able to see the day restart on Animal Crossing, which I&amp;rsquo;d never done before, so yay?) and then was able to get back to sleep for a couple of hours and then I was up for the day. And I&amp;rsquo;m still in a bit of pain. Boo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My code editor&amp;ndash;Atom&amp;ndash;is being sunset at the end of the year, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking for alternatives. I&amp;rsquo;m leaning towards Sublime Text and Sublime Merge over VSCode, mainly because I feel like VSCode is bloated as all get out. It makes me cranky, though, because I &lt;em>finally&lt;/em> got a good workflow going in Atom and managed to learn a bunch of keyboard shortcuts and now I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to learn different ones. Meh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to rework the colors here, but maybe this weekend? There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of weirdness in the CSS&amp;ndash;like the theme&amp;rsquo;s author made a &lt;em>separate&lt;/em> CSS file for each partial template and is importing them into the main CSS which is, just, weird.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is mostly a post to make a post. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about SFF fandom and how Certain Parties just seem so intent on stirring shit up with their ridiculous s&amp;mdash;-core concept, something which defines a &lt;em>negative&lt;/em> and not what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, which is a lot of body horror. I don&amp;rsquo;t think SFF necessarily needs more body horror, thanks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, these people don&amp;rsquo;t actually seem to be very widely read in SFF and therefore think that no one is reading or writing &amp;ldquo;dark&amp;rdquo; fiction and well, that&amp;rsquo;s a crock of shit. And they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>very&lt;/em> intent on lionizing GRRM for some reason. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of thinking about this whole thing for the past few months and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping, at some point, to be able to write something coherent about it as opposed to what I&amp;rsquo;ve just written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now? It&amp;rsquo;s time for me to get to work! Work! How glorious it is to be able to work at a job that I really enjoy and that I seem to be reasonably good at? I mean, still a newbie developer, but I&amp;rsquo;m learning and seem to be learning fast enough.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
