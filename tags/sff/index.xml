One for getting this site set up as I want it to be, and another for mothballing my old site.&lt;/p>

The character is wearing a red hat and a blue shirt that has a white cat on it shooting laser beam out of its eyes. The character&amp;rsquo;s eyes are half-closed, their mouth is open in dismay, and there are two bubble floating near their head. It&amp;rsquo;s evening.">&lt;/p>

Burn it all down, my children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Random Thoughts (June 9)</title><link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/random-thoughts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 09:52:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/random-thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oof.
