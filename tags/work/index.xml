      <description>Me: Oh, let me change the theme, it won&amp;rsquo;t that big of a deal.
time passes
Me: Six hours isn&amp;rsquo;t bad, right?
 So, yes: I did change a few colors. And the font, and the entire theme. And I made a colophon page and managed to actually code it in properly. Which is pretty exciting, not gonna lie.
Anyhow. I&amp;rsquo;m sure some things look funky and I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice.</description>

      <description>It has been a week here.
I have:
 successfully wrangled custom radio button hover and focus states  the html radio buttons were offset from the custom ones and moving them helped the hover happen in the right places I am still mad at whoever originally coded the component, though   got a chunk of coding done for the mobile version of the site footer  the desktop version is good to go, but I have a few more bootstrap/flexbox things to figure out   helped a user regain access to their account using nothing more than an old photograph of their phone&amp;rsquo;s screen and a vague list of tasks.</description>
