      <description>The art of losing isn’t hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.
 Four years ago today, I almost died.
And while I didn&amp;rsquo;t lose my life, I have had to master the art of losing nonetheless.

 Let America Be America Again Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free.
(America never was America to me.</description>
