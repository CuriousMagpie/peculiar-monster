      <description>It has been a week here.
I have:
 successfully wrangled custom radio button hover and focus states  the html radio buttons were offset from the custom ones and moving them helped the hover happen in the right places I am still mad at whoever originally coded the component, though   got a chunk of coding done for the mobile version of the site footer  the desktop version is good to go, but I have a few more bootstrap/flexbox things to figure out   helped a user regain access to their account using nothing more than an old photograph of their phone&amp;rsquo;s screen and a vague list of tasks.</description>
