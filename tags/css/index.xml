&lt;p>I have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>successfully wrangled custom radio button hover and focus states
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the html radio buttons were offset from the custom ones and moving them helped the hover happen in the right places&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am still mad at whoever originally coded the component, though&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>got a chunk of coding done for the mobile version of the site footer
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the desktop version is good to go, but I have a few more bootstrap/flexbox things to figure out&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>helped a user regain access to their account using nothing more than an old photograph of their phone&amp;rsquo;s screen and a vague list of tasks. I felt like a fucking wizard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>installed &lt;a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty&lt;/a> to use for the Pretty Terrible archive
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it&amp;rsquo;s mostly done, but I&amp;rsquo;m still messing with the css and attempting to get some data to show up the way I&amp;rsquo;d like it to&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also need to pull the images that the posts I&amp;rsquo;m keeping need&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>managed to write an &lt;code>npm start&lt;/code> script for the 11ty site which launches the local server and runs sass so I can map color hex codes to variables along with other things
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>this makes me happy, because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to change colors uses sass variables&lt;/li>
&lt;li>also, the easier the command is for me to launch something on the command line, the happier I am&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m now trying to figure out how to do this for some of my personal Habitica scripts&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fiddled with the template here a tiny bit, but not as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like&lt;/li>
&lt;li>thought about changing the template here, but the sunk cost fallacy has come into play so I don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/li>
&lt;li>finished re-reading Katherine Addison&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>The Goblin Emperor&lt;/em> and I&amp;rsquo;m now re-reading &lt;em>Witness for the Dead&lt;/em> and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably re-read &lt;em>Grief of Stones&lt;/em>, too&amp;ndash;I have an essay started about that one, so I do want to be sure of the themes, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>beat Tetris Effects Journey mode on Beginner&lt;/li>
&lt;li>called the local hospital system to make sure that all my bills are accounted for in the billing system and figured out how to access my account online; they keep changing systems (MAKE UP YOUR MINDS, PEOPLE) and access is a constant struggle and they are constantly sending me paper bills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>paid a lingering Labcorp bill&lt;/li>
&lt;li>paid my therapist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>paid the household bills and balanced the household budget
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>this included re-registering my car and filing the deed which came in the mail since my car is all paid off now&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>messaged my GI doctor about medical marijuana&lt;/li>
&lt;li>did a bunch of knitting
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I had to more or less rip out a mostly-complete project that had been in hibernation for at least five years due to breaks in the yarn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It was weird, the breaks were &lt;em>only&lt;/em> in the gray yarn and not the variegated, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what happened&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BUT on the plus side, I&amp;rsquo;ve done way more of this designer&amp;rsquo;s patterns in the time between putting this project in hibernation and now, so the bits I was struggling with that made me shove this in a bag and forget about it aren&amp;rsquo;t really an issue anymore&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I still have a few things to do today. I have an appointment for a paracentesis this afternoon. I was planning on working between therapy and shortly before I had to leave, but I woke up this morning feeling like utter garbage so bailed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Miles has been very attentive&amp;ndash;he knows when I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling well and will pester me to go to bed. I think that&amp;rsquo;s what his attentiveness this morning was about, but he has since given up and is napping on his perch by the front window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also gave in and purchased an Amazon spy speaker. My SIL has them in her house and it was really convenient to just be able to ask it to play music or to tell me when an hour had passed. Yes, I know this is how they get you. I am probably going to get a couple more on Prime Day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weekend plans include more fussing with 11ty and the PT archive and probably more work on this site&amp;rsquo;s template. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to go all out and knit, play Animal Crossing, and do some laundry. I know, my life is so exciting!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Messing Around</title><link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/messing-around/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 00:38:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/messing-around/</guid><description>&lt;p>So here I am, in the wee hours of the morning, having frittered away the last 7 hours of my life on a few &amp;ldquo;quick&amp;rdquo; updates to the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except I kept thinking of new ways to do things or fixing errors with the style sheets to the point where, except for the general layout and the little cactus icon up there (which is going to be replaced soon, I swear), it&amp;rsquo;s basically a whole new theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s held together with duct tape and bubblegum at this point, but it &lt;em>works&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I made a new &lt;code>theme.toml&lt;/code> file and claimed it as my own&amp;ndash;obviously, giving credit to the previous developers who worked on it within the file. It&amp;rsquo;s nowhere &lt;em>near&lt;/em> ready to publish and honestly? I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I want to. It&amp;rsquo;s missing a lot of the things that people look for: no search, no emoji support, no pagination between posts,&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> no analytics, and probably a bunch of other things as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three of the four things on that list are coming (search, emoji support, and pagination) and I will not use analytics. I might put some parameters in for Fathom, because they do have a strong privacy policy, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll use them myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I added a couple of things that other folks probably don&amp;rsquo;t think or care about: a clear statement of what&amp;rsquo;s going on here with regards to privacy and an acknowledgment that I reside on the traditional lands of the Lenapehoking people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s now a full text RSS feed, praise Jesus and pass the mashed potatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other thing I did today was spend $2,236 and change on getting my car&amp;rsquo;s 30,000 mile service and front and back brake repairs. We&amp;rsquo;re going on a short road trip next week and it needed to be done. The Blubaru is 5 years old and only has 28,000 miles on her&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m expecting to drive her for another 10 years, at least.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then I went to pick up a prescription (I have been to CVS 4 times in the last 2 weeks, because can they sync up the 4 things I pick up from them in person? no, no they cannot) which cost me the princely sum of $0.39. So that&amp;rsquo;s something, I guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also spent a few hours this afternoon&amp;ndash;while waiting to hear from the dealership about the car&amp;ndash;working on my mosaic knitting project. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and if I apply myself, I may be able to finish before we head out of town&amp;ndash;which means I could potentially cast on for something else. Or get out one of my many WIPs. I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll see what I may be in the mood to bring along with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomorrow is laundry and putting together a packing list and perhaps attempting to work my way through the rest of the to do list that I&amp;rsquo;ve been ignoring for a good chunk of the week (my weeks start on Monday).&lt;/p>
&lt;section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
&lt;p>The previous developer was apparently using jQuery for that. And only that. Let us not.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/section></description></item><item><title>Better Colors?</title><link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/better-colors/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 23:21:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/better-colors/</guid><description>&lt;p>The spaghetti that is this site&amp;rsquo;s CSS is really something else&amp;ndash;to the point where using the override files just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because there&amp;rsquo;s so much stuff squirreled away in different places and it all takes different precedence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a kanban board for the things I want to do and a bunch of them include &amp;ldquo;refactor and consolidate X, Y, or Z.&amp;rdquo; I suspect that when I&amp;rsquo;m done, it&amp;rsquo;ll be an entirely new template.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not thrilled with the colors and I think I need to rework them so there are more constrast colors and less four different shades of pinky-purple. But at least I managed to fix the damn fonts and hyphenation. The previous choices were&amp;ndash;choices. Yes. That&amp;rsquo;s the word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a two hour nap with Miles this afternoon. He&amp;rsquo;s the only cat I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been able to nap with&amp;ndash;I can say to him, &amp;ldquo;Miles, want to come take a nap?&amp;rdquo; and he&amp;rsquo;ll get up from wherever he&amp;rsquo;s at (on a cat tree, in a sunbeam) to follow me into the bedroom and wait relatively patiently for me to get my glasses off and the white noise on and get into bed&amp;ndash;and then he&amp;rsquo;ll hop up and settle himself on my chest and we&amp;rsquo;ll both sleep and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to not suffocate in his fur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I&amp;rsquo;m having a bad body day, he&amp;rsquo;ll often herd me to bed to take a nap. It&amp;rsquo;s like he &lt;em>knows&lt;/em> somehow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at night&amp;ndash;he sometimes sleeps at the foot of the bed at night, but he prefers other places to do his important cat business overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s a funny cat, but he&amp;rsquo;s my cat and I love him so much. He&amp;rsquo;s the very best black cat I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. (I really can&amp;rsquo;t quantify which cat&amp;rsquo;s the best of the best, they&amp;rsquo;ve all been great in different ways&amp;ndash;all very different personalities.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Code, Why Are You Like This?</title><link>https://peculiar.monster/posts/code-why-are-you-like-this/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 11:35:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://peculiar.monster/posts/code-why-are-you-like-this/</guid><description>&lt;p>And of course, no sooner than I finished my previous post and decided to deploy the site than I ran into a bunch of problems, some bigger than others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I had to set the DNS record to point at GitHub Pages. And that takes time to propogate and I am &lt;em>impatient&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DNS wasn&amp;rsquo;t propogating and GH was tellng me that I&amp;rsquo;d configured something wrong, so it recommended that I set &lt;code>A&lt;/code> records to point at the GitHub Pages IP addresses&amp;hellip;except it didn&amp;rsquo;t actually link to where I could &lt;em>find&lt;/em> those IP addresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I finally found them buried in GH&amp;rsquo;s documentation, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be damned if I can find the page again, even with searching through my browser history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also set up the &lt;code>CNAME&lt;/code> record at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I had to set up the GitHub workflow to actually deploy from my repo to the page&amp;ndash;and unbeknownst to me, there was a &lt;em>critical&lt;/em> piece of missing information from the workflow as written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that piece of information was setting &lt;code>cname: peculiar.monster&lt;/code> in the deploy script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seriously. &lt;code>CNAME&lt;/code> kept on disappearing from the &lt;code>gh-pages&lt;/code> branch and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out why until I looked at &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action#%EF%B8%8F-add-cname-file-cname">this GH Action&lt;/a> which mentioned setting &lt;code>CNAME&lt;/code>, while &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-setup">the Hugo-specific action&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;the one I chose to use&amp;ndash;did not mention it anywhere. No wonder it was being removed!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, with that sorted, I turned my attention to why either the theme or Hugo wasn&amp;rsquo;t respecting my `&lt;/p>
&lt;p>` tag. Turned out that &lt;em>Hugo&lt;/em> was respecting it just fine and the theme absolutely was not&amp;ndash;and of course, this isn&amp;rsquo;t actually documented &lt;em>in&lt;/em> the theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After digging through the CSS, I figured out where the problem was, it was in a bit of code from &lt;code>themes/LoveIt/assets/css/_page/_home.scss&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-scss" data-lang="scss">&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f"> 1&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">.home&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">data-home&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">posts&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">]&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f"> 2&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">.summary&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f"> 3&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">.content&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f"> 4&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">@include&lt;/span> box(vertical);
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f"> 5&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">-webkit-line-clamp&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">:&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">3&lt;/span>;
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f"> 6&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">margin-top&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">:&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">.3&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd">rem&lt;/span>;
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f"> 7&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">width&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">:&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#bd93f9">100&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#8be9fd">%&lt;/span>;
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f"> 8&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">overflow&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">:&lt;/span> hidden;
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f"> 9&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">text-overflow&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">:&lt;/span> ellipsis;
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">10&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">@include&lt;/span> overflow-wrap(break-word);
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">11&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">color&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">:&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">$global-font-secondary-color&lt;/span>;
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">12&lt;/span> }
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">13&lt;/span> }
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">14&lt;/span>}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I did delete the classes that weren&amp;rsquo;t relevant to the problem at hand&amp;ndash;the &lt;code>home[data-home=posts]&lt;/code> class has a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> going on, more than is relevant to explain the current problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit of research, however, quickly helped me to figure out that &lt;code>-webkit-line-clamp: 3;&lt;/code> was the culprit. It was restricting the summary display to three lines, it was a class I am not familiar with, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what the options were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, how to fix it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not a methodical sort of person, alas&amp;ndash;and looking at the code condensed like I did above actually helped me to get to a solution&amp;ndash;but my normal way of doing things is to just throw lines of code at the problem and see if anything sticks. This is a terrible habit that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to break&amp;ndash;it was fine when coding was something I did occasionally and for fun, but it&amp;rsquo;s not great when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write code at work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And here&amp;rsquo;s the answer, to the LoveIt theme disrespecting summary length and the &lt;code>&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tag, placed within &lt;code>assets/css/_custom.scss&lt;/code>. :sweat_smile:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-scss" data-lang="scss">&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">1&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">.home&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">data-home&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">posts&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">]&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">2&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">.summary&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">3&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">.content&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">4&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">-webkit-line-clamp&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">:&lt;/span> none;
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">5&lt;/span> }
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">6&lt;/span> }
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">7&lt;/span>}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then there was the problem with the paragraphs not being properly separated and the spacing just being weird. That was easy to solve, just a few more lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-scss" data-lang="scss">&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">1&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">.home&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">data-home&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">posts&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">]&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">2&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">.summary&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">3&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">.content&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">p&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">4&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#50fa7b">display&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ff79c6">:&lt;/span> block;
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">5&lt;/span> }
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">6&lt;/span> }
&lt;span style="margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">7&lt;/span>}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And there, everything is so much more to my liking. :tada:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
