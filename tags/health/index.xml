      <description>The art of losing isnâ€™t hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.
 Four years ago today, I almost died.
And while I didn&amp;rsquo;t lose my life, I have had to master the art of losing nonetheless.
First The first thing I lost was my health. I&amp;rsquo;d been almost rudely healthy up to that point. I&amp;rsquo;d never been seriously sick beyond a couple of bouts of flu in my 20&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>I am just not feeling the thing this week.
I had a mere 2.5L drained last week1 and you&amp;rsquo;d think that would have helped and&amp;ndash;nope.
I feel bloated and I basically haven&amp;rsquo;t felt hungry so there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of forcing myself to eat and then I feel like I overate and it&amp;rsquo;s just not pleasant.
And I&amp;rsquo;m having weird random pain in my gut, but not enough to actually call my doctor or go to the ER about.</description>

      <title>Random Thoughts (June 9)</title>

      <description>Oof. I went in for my monthly-ish paracentesis yesterday morning.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what this is, here&amp;rsquo;s a handy explainer from Wikipedia.
First of all, I was up entirely too early for my own good. But it did mean I was able to take my meds and eat breakfast before having to leave for the hospital, so that&amp;rsquo;s something, yes?
Normally, it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad, but the doctor doing them yesterday was a resident and while she was very nice and perfectly competent, she was also still a resident, which means that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t as skilled as some of the doctors who have been there for years.</description>
