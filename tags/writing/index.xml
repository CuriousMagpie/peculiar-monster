One for getting this site set up as I want it to be, and another for mothballing my old site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They both have a LOT of things on them.

&lt;p>While this is a new site, I am not new to blogging. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging one way or another since 1999, give or take. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of different sites over the years&amp;ndash;from Diaryland to Greymatter to Movable Type to LiveJournal to WordPress and now I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a> because, to be quite honest, I am unhappy with the direction WordPress has taken their product&amp;ndash;they seem to assume that everyone wants to sell something and too often what&amp;rsquo;s for sale is a piece of someone&amp;rsquo;s soul.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no desire to make this site generate any sort of regular source of income or to leverage it into something bigger than what it is. I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for visibility or followers or to become any sort of influencer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a place to document my life and how I&amp;rsquo;m living it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
