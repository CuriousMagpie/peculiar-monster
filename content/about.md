# Hello!

I am:

- a cyborgified human being[^1]
- femme non-binary
- my pronouns are she/they
- married to a wonderful man since 2006, but we've been partners since 1998
- chronically ill with a whole bunch of _fascinating_ things[^2]
- owned by two cats, Miles and Ivan (_yes, nominative determinism is a thing_)
- a voracious reader of speculative fiction and possessed of many opinions
- including that George R.R. Martin can fuck off into the sun[^3]
- loser of not one, but two Hugo Awards
- a knitter, crocheter, and spinner
- a failed poet
- a watercolor painter and sticker collector
- in recovery from a corporate America and toxic productivity
- a web developer--mostly JavaScript and Vue.js--for [Habitica.com](https://www.habitica.com)
- doing my best to get away from the algorithmically fuelled web, as I have come to believe that it is [fundamentally harmful to human beings](https://www.humanetech.com/)

[^1]:That is, I use an [insulin pump](https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/products/t-slim-x2-insulin-pump), a [continuous glucose monitor](https://www.dexcom.com/), have a [port-a-cath](https://nurse.org/articles/what-is-a-port-a-cath/) for IVs and blood draws, and an [IUD](https://www.liletta.com/).

I am a lot of fun at parties.
