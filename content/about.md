# Hello!

I am:

- a cyborgified human being
- femme non-binary, so my pronouns are she/they
- chronically ill with a whole bunch of _fascinating_ things
- owned by two cats, Miles and Ivan (_yes, nominative determinism is a thing_)
- a voracious reader of speculative fiction and possessed of many opinions
- including that George R.R. Martin can fuck off into the sun
- loser of not one, but two Hugo Awards
- a knitter, crocheter, and spinner
- a failed poet
- a watercolor painter and sticker collector
- in recovery from a corporate America and toxic productivity
- a web developer--mostly JavaScript and Vue.js--for [Habitica.com](https://www.habitica.com)
