# Hello!

I am:

- a cyborgified human being[^1]
- femme non-binary, so my pronouns are she/they
- chronically ill with a whole bunch of _fascinating_ things[^2]
- owned by two cats, Miles and Ivan (_yes, nominative determinism is a thing_)
- a voracious reader of speculative fiction and possessed of many opinions
- including that George R.R. Martin can fuck off into the sun[^3]
- loser of not one, but two Hugo Awards
- a knitter, crocheter, and spinner
- a failed poet
- a watercolor painter and sticker collector
- in recovery from a corporate America and toxic productivity
- a web developer--mostly JavaScript and Vue.js--for [Habitica.com](https://www.habitica.com)
- doing my best to get away from the algorithmically fuelled web, as I have come to believe that it is [fundamentally harmful to human beings](https://www.humanetech.com/)

[^1]:That is, I use an insulin pump, have a central line, and an IUD.
[^2]: [Necrotizing pancreatitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5565044/), [pancreatic ascites](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507851/), [portal vein thrombosis & hypertension](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4415192/), [type 3c diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5495015/), generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and [DESNOS/cPTSD](https://en.yestherapyhelps.com/desnos-complex-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-13784). I am a lot of fun at parties.
[^3]:From August 2020 until December 2021, I was the most-hated fan in all of science fiction. Cause I said mean things about George and used swears.
