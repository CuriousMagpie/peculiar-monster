# Hello!

I am:
- pseudonymous--that is, everything that is written here should be credited to GigaMeow and not any portion of my legal name
- not using any trackers, cookies, or analytics on this site--as I am respecting _your_ privacy, please respect mine
- a cyborgified human being[^1]
- femme non-binary and my pronouns are she/they
- married to a wonderful man since 2006, but we've been partners since 1998
- chronically ill with a whole bunch of _fascinating_ things[^2]
- owned by two cats, Miles and Ivan (_yes, nominative determinism is a thing_)
- a voracious reader of speculative fiction and possessed of many opinions
-   including that George R.R. Martin can fuck off into the sun[^3]
- a loser of not one, but two Hugo Awards
- a knitter, crocheter, and spinner
- a failed poet
- a watercolor painter and sticker collector
- in recovery from a corporate America and toxic productivity
- a web developer--mostly JavaScript and Vue.js--for [Habitica.com](https://www.habitica.com)
- doing my best to get away from the algorithmically fuelled web, as I have come to believe that it is [fundamentally harmful to human beings](https://www.humanetech.com/)
