So, yes: I did change a few colors. And the font, and the entire theme. And I made a colophon page and managed to actually code it in properly. Which is pretty exciting, not gonna lie.

Anyhow. I'm sure some things look funky and I didn't notice. But I like this theme a whole lot better than the one I was trying to make do what I wanted it to do. There's actual pagination! There aren't a whole bunch of CSS files that are cobbled together and there's a reasonable way for someone like me to go ahead and customize the theme on an ad hoc basis. Like the colors. And the fonts. Because I can't help myself.

Looking into changing my hosting situation--we'll see.

Moving right along...

One of my projects at work went live last week: a modal that allows users to give each other gift subscriptions or gems (one of the app's currencies, you can purchase via a subscription or use actual money) and it's so beautiful! And, with luck, it will help reduce a lot of the gifting errors that we end up having to fix during the annual Give One, Get One subscription sale. And I learned so *much* from the project in terms of how things in the codebase fit together, and figuring out why things weren't working and then fixing them--it was great. And my radio buttons are so pretty.

I also finished the cursed knitting project and shoved it in the bin of projects that need the ends woven in--and one of the cats proceeded to pee on the cloth that I put on top of the bin to protect it from the cats. So I guess it did its job and I guess I'm washing towels and other household linens this week. And contemplating a lid.

Reading-wise, I read Annabeth Albert's [Conventionally Yours](https://amzn.to/3ovqnzA)[^1] and it was really cute and fun. A fantasy card game, a road trip, and a tournament--and two really well-developed characters, that I was rooting for the entire time.

But for now, I think I'm going to go watch some documentaries and work on my new knitting project--a wool/cashmere scarf from a pattern by Casapinka called [Circus Movement](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/circus-movement).[^2]
