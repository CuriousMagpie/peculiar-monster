This is another post. I'm testing a few things out.

:(far fa-grin-tears):
<!--more-->

{{< admonition type=quote title="Language, by Suzanne Vega" open=true >}}
If language were liquid it would be rushing in\
Instead here we are\
In a silence more eloquent than any word could ever be\

These words are too solid\
They don't move fast enough\
To catch the blur in the brain that flies by\

And is gone and is gone\
And is gone, gone\
Gone, gone and is gone
{{< /admonition >}}
