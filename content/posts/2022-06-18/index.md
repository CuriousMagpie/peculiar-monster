So here I am, in the wee hours of the morning, having frittered away the last 7 hours of my life on a few "quick" updates to the site.

Except I kept thinking of new ways to do things or fixing errors with the style sheets to the point where, except for the general layout and the little cactus icon up there (which is going to be replaced soon, I swear), it's basically a whole new theme.

I mean, it's held together with duct tape and bubblegum at this point, but it _works_.

So I made a new `theme.toml` file and claimed it as my own--obviously, giving credit to the previous developers who worked on it within the file. It's nowhere _near_ ready to publish and honestly? I don't know if I want to. It's missing a lot of the things that people look for: no search, no emoji support, no pagination between posts,[^1] no analytics, and probably a bunch of other things as well.

Three of the four things on that list are coming (search, emoji support, and pagination) and I will not use analytics. I might put some parameters in for Fathom, because they do have a strong privacy policy, but I don't think I'll use them myself.

And I added a couple of things that other folks probably don't think or care about: a clear statement of what's going on here with regards to privacy and an acknowledgment that I reside on the traditional lands of the Lenapehoking people.

Oh, and there's now a full text RSS feed, praise Jesus and pass the mashed potatoes.

The other thing I did today was spend $2,236 and change on getting my car's 30,000 mile service and front and back brake repairs. We're going on a short road trip next week and it needed to be done. The Blubaru is 5 years old and only has 28,000 miles on her--I'm expecting to drive her for another 10 years, at least.

And then I went to pick up a prescription (I have been to CVS 4 times in the last 2 weeks, because can they sync up the 4 things I pick up from them in person? no, no they cannot) which cost me the princely sum of $0.39. So that's something, I guess. 

I also spent a few hours this afternoon--while waiting to hear from the dealership about the car--working on my mosaic knitting project. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and if I apply myself, I may be able to finish before we head out of town--which means I could potentially cast on for something else. Or get out one of my many WIPs. I guess we'll see what I may be in the mood to bring along with me.

Tomorrow is laundry and putting together a packing list and perhaps attempting to work my way through the rest of the to do list that I've been ignoring for a good chunk of the week (my weeks start on Monday).

[^1]: The previous developer was apparently using jQuery for that. And only that. Let us not.
