Oof. I went in for my monthly-ish paracentesis yesterday morning.

If you don't know what this is, here's [a handy explainer from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracentesis).

<!--more-->
First of all, I was up entirely too early for my own good. But it did mean I was able to take my meds and eat breakfast before having to leave for the hospital, so that's something, yes?

Normally, it's not too bad, but the doctor doing them yesterday was a resident and while she was very nice and perfectly competent, she was also still a _resident_, which means that she wasn't as skilled as some of the doctors who have been there for years. And I'm a bit of a tough case--I get tapped on my left side, not the right, and I'm not a high volume person anymore (thank God--that's 5L or more).

When I got home, I took my pain meds and went directly to bed. I ended up spending most of the day in bed, which meant I didn't get good sleep last night--which means I was up at 4:30 am this morning for a few hours (I was able to see the day restart on Animal Crossing, which I'd never done before, so yay?) and then was able to get back to sleep for a couple of hours and then I was up for the day. And I'm still in a bit of pain. Boo.

My code editor--Atom--is being sunset at the end of the year, so I'm looking for alternatives. I'm leaning towards Sublime Text and Sublime Merge over VSCode, mainly because I feel like VSCode is bloated as all get out. It makes me cranky, though, because I _finally_ got a good workflow going in Atom and managed to learn a bunch of keyboard shortcuts and now I'm going to have to learn different ones. Meh.

Still haven't had a chance to rework the colors here, but maybe this weekend? There's a lot of weirdness in the CSS--like the theme's author made a _separate_ CSS file for each partial template and is importing them into the main CSS which is, just, weird.

This is mostly a post to make a post. I've been thinking a lot about SFF fandom and how Certain Parties just seem so intent on stirring shit up with their ridiculous s----core concept, something which defines a _negative_ and not what they're doing, which is a lot of body horror. I don't think SFF necessarily needs more body horror, thanks.

Also, these people don't actually seem to be very widely read in SFF and therefore think that no one is reading or writing "dark" fiction and well, that's a crock of shit. And they're _very_ intent on lionizing GRRM for some reason. I don't know why.

Anyhow, I've been doing a lot of thinking about this whole thing for the past few months and I'm hoping, at some point, to be able to write something coherent about it as opposed to what I've just written.

And now? It's time for me to get to work! Work! How glorious it is to be able to work at a job that I really enjoy and that I seem to be reasonably good at? I mean, still a newbie developer, but I'm learning and seem to be learning fast enough.
