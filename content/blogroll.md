I used to read so many blogs and other sources of information. Sadly, fewer and fewer folks are blogging on their own sites and instead opt for places like Twitter or Substack, the latter often behind a paywall (And yet, nearly all of the newsletters I'm going to recommend are on Substack; probably because Substack positions itself as a content provider and not a way to get people into your sales funnel).

# Newsletters
- [The Full Lid](https://mailchi.mp/5a1f74b9a7fd/thefulllid) Written by Alasdair Stuart and Marguerite Kenner, this is a weekly cornucopia of goodness.
- [Amal Content](https://amal.substack.com/) Come for the puns, stay for Amal El-Mohtar's thoughtful and heartfelt posts.
- [The Rest is Commentary](https://hanneblankboyd.substack.com/) Currently a placeholder, but as it's Hanne Blank Boyd's placeholder, I'm expecting great things here.
- [Throw Another Bear in the Canoe](https://throwanotherbearinthecanoe.substack.com/) Elizabeth Bear's newsletter. Regular updates and also mirrored on her Patreon. Mix of paid and free posts. A paid subscription gets you access to a Discord server.
- [The Lynchline](https://scottlynch.substack.com) Scott Lynch's newsletter. Infrequent posts, but they're always super extra good.
- [The Third Place](https://maxgladstone.substack.com/) While Max Gladstone doesn't post more than once or twice a month, it's absolutely worth your while to subscribe. All essays are free to read, but commenting requires a token subscription.
- [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com) Most content is free, the paid version gets you access to the Friday open posts and a Discord server which is high traffic but full of good peeps.
- [Homeculture](https://homeculture.substack.com/) One free essay a week, commenting and any other extra essays requires a paid subscription. I do want to note that Meg Conley is rather assertive about asking for payment but she does so in the context that subscriptions help pay for her childcare which then allows her the time she needs to write. And since one of her main topic is care work, it makes total sense.
- [Griefbacon](https://griefbacon.substack.com/) Confessional, personal essays by Helena Fitzgerald.
- [Pop Culture Spirit Wow](https://jimmcdermott.substack.com) A Jesuit writes weekly updates about what he finds interesting in pop culture every week. It's great.
