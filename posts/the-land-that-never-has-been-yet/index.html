<h1 id=let-america-be-america-again>Let America Be America Again<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#let-america-be-america-again>#</a></h1>
<p>Let America be America again.<br>
Let it be the dream it used to be.<br>
Let it be the pioneer on the plain<br>
Seeking a home where he himself is free.</p>
<p>(America never was America to me.)</p>
<p>Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed—</p>
<p>Let it be that great strong land of love<br>
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme<br>
That any man be crushed by one above.</p>
<p>(It never was America to me.)</p>
<p>O, let my land be a land where Liberty</p>
<p>Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,<br>
But opportunity is real, and life is free,<br>
Equality is in the air we breathe.</p>
<p>(There’s never been equality for me,<br>
Nor freedom in this “homeland of the free.”)</p>
<p><em>Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark?</em><br>
<em>And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?</em></p>
<p>I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,<br>
I am the Negro bearing slavery’s scars.<br>
I am the red man driven from the land,<br>
I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek—<br>
And finding only the same old stupid plan<br>
Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.</p>
<p>I am the young man, full of strength and hope,<br>
Tangled in that ancient endless chain<br>
Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land!<br>
Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!<br>
Of work the men! Of take the pay!<br>
Of owning everything for one’s own greed!</p>
<p>I am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.<br>
I am the worker sold to the machine.<br>
I am the Negro, servant to you all.<br>
I am the people, humble, hungry, mean—<br>
Hungry yet today despite the dream.<br>
Beaten yet today—O, Pioneers!<br>
I am the man who never got ahead,<br>
The poorest worker bartered through the years.</p>
<p>Yet I’m the one who dreamt our basic dream<br>
In the Old World while still a serf of kings,<br>
Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,<br>
That even yet its mighty daring sings<br>
In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned<br>
That’s made America the land it has become.<br>
O, I’m the man who sailed those early seas<br>
In search of what I meant to be my home—<br>
For I’m the one who left dark Ireland’s shore,<br>
And Poland’s plain, and England’s grassy lea,<br>
And torn from Black Africa’s strand I came<br>
To build a “homeland of the free.”</p>
<p>The free?</p>
<p>Who said the free? Not me?<br>
Surely not me? The millions on relief today?<br>
The millions shot down when we strike?<br>
The millions who have nothing for our pay?<br>
For all the dreams we’ve dreamed<br>
And all the songs we’ve sung<br>
And all the hopes we’ve held<br>
And all the flags we’ve hung,<br>
The millions who have nothing for our pay—<br>
Except the dream that’s almost dead today.</p>
<p>O, let America be America again—<br>
The land that never has been yet—<br>
And yet must be—the land where <em>every</em> man is free.<br>
The land that’s mine—the poor man’s, Indian’s, Negro’s, ME—<br>
Who made America,<br>
Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,<br>
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,<br>
Must bring back our mighty dream again.</p>
<p>Sure, call me any ugly name you choose—<br>
The steel of freedom does not stain.<br>
From those who live like leeches on the people’s lives,<br>
We must take back our land again,<br>
America!</p>
<p>O, yes,<br>
I say it plain,<br>
America never was America to me,<br>
And yet I swear this oath—<br>
America will be!</p>
<p>Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,<br>
The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,<br>
We, the people, must redeem<br>
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.<br>
The mountains and the endless plain—<br>
All, all the stretch of these great green states—<br>
And make America again!</p>
<p>&ndash;<em>Langston Hughes</em></p>
