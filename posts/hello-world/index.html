<p>While this is a new site, I am not new to blogging. I&rsquo;ve been blogging one way or another since 1999, give or take. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of different sites over the years&ndash;from Diaryland to Greymatter to Movable Type to LiveJournal to WordPress and now I&rsquo;m using <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> because, to be quite honest, I am unhappy with the direction WordPress has taken their product&ndash;they seem to assume that everyone wants to sell something and too often what&rsquo;s for sale is a piece of someone&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>I have no desire to make this site generate any sort of regular source of income or to leverage it into something bigger than what it is. I&rsquo;m not looking for visibility or followers or to become any sort of influencer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a place to document my life and how I&rsquo;m living it.</p>
<p>I <em>miss</em> writing for its own sake. There are so many things I want to write about and haven&rsquo;t felt as if I can, in part because technology is getting in my way.</p>
<p>WordPress is an unwieldy beast and every time I log on, there&rsquo;s <em>something</em> that needs updating. I hate that things I&rsquo;d consider to be part of the core functionality of a CMS isn&rsquo;t there and there&rsquo;s a whole ecosystem of people making their living selling that core functionality to you&ndash;and if they run on a freemium model, the plugins call home, which is a significant privacy and security concern.</p>
<p>I am planning to mothball my old site and unpublishing nearly all the posts; what I&rsquo;m planning on leaving behind will be converted to static site, probably using <a href=https://www.11ty.dev/>11ty</a>, because playing with frameworks is fun and their name makes me laugh.</p>

<p>I was <a href=https://institute.global/policy/social-media-futures-what-brigading>brigaded on Twitter</a> earlier this year for a casual, off-hand remark I made to some friends after the Hugo Awards ceremony and the ringleaders harassed me for <em>months</em> for no reason other that they <em>could</em>.
