If you don&rsquo;t know what this is, here&rsquo;s a handy explainer from Wikipedia.
First of all, I was up entirely too early for my own good. But it did mean I was able to take my meds and eat breakfast before having to leave for the hospital, so that&rsquo;s something, yes?
Normally, it&rsquo;s not too bad, but the doctor doing them yesterday was a resident and while she was very nice and perfectly competent, she was also still a resident, which means that she wasn&rsquo;t as skilled as some of the doctors who have been there for years.">

<p>Oof. I went in for my monthly-ish paracentesis yesterday morning.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what this is, here&rsquo;s <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracentesis>a handy explainer from Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>First of all, I was up entirely too early for my own good. But it did mean I was able to take my meds and eat breakfast before having to leave for the hospital, so that&rsquo;s something, yes?</p>
<p>Normally, it&rsquo;s not too bad, but the doctor doing them yesterday was a resident and while she was very nice and perfectly competent, she was also still a <em>resident</em>, which means that she wasn&rsquo;t as skilled as some of the doctors who have been there for years. And I&rsquo;m a bit of a tough case&ndash;I get tapped on my left side, not the right, and I&rsquo;m not a high volume person anymore (thank God&ndash;that&rsquo;s 5L or more).</p>
<p>When I got home, I took my pain meds and went directly to bed. I ended up spending most of the day in bed, which meant I didn&rsquo;t get good sleep last night&ndash;which means I was up at 4:30 am this morning for a few hours (I was able to see the day restart on Animal Crossing, which I&rsquo;d never done before, so yay?) and then was able to get back to sleep for a couple of hours and then I was up for the day. And I&rsquo;m still in a bit of pain. Boo.</p>
<p>My code editor&ndash;Atom&ndash;is being sunset at the end of the year, so I&rsquo;m looking for alternatives. I&rsquo;m leaning towards Sublime Text and Sublime Merge over VSCode, mainly because I feel like VSCode is bloated as all get out. It makes me cranky, though, because I <em>finally</em> got a good workflow going in Atom and managed to learn a bunch of keyboard shortcuts and now I&rsquo;m going to have to learn different ones. Meh.</p>
<p>Still haven&rsquo;t had a chance to rework the colors here, but maybe this weekend? There&rsquo;s a lot of weirdness in the CSS&ndash;like the theme&rsquo;s author made a <em>separate</em> CSS file for each partial template and is importing them into the main CSS which is, just, weird.</p>
<p>This is mostly a post to make a post. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about SFF fandom and how Certain Parties just seem so intent on stirring shit up with their ridiculous s&mdash;-core concept, something which defines a <em>negative</em> and not what they&rsquo;re doing, which is a lot of body horror. I don&rsquo;t think SFF necessarily needs more body horror, thanks.</p>
<p>Also, these people don&rsquo;t actually seem to be very widely read in SFF and therefore think that no one is reading or writing &ldquo;dark&rdquo; fiction and well, that&rsquo;s a crock of shit. And they&rsquo;re <em>very</em> intent on lionizing GRRM for some reason. I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of thinking about this whole thing for the past few months and I&rsquo;m hoping, at some point, to be able to write something coherent about it as opposed to what I&rsquo;ve just written.</p>
<p>And now? It&rsquo;s time for me to get to work! Work! How glorious it is to be able to work at a job that I really enjoy and that I seem to be reasonably good at? I mean, still a newbie developer, but I&rsquo;m learning and seem to be learning fast enough.</p>
